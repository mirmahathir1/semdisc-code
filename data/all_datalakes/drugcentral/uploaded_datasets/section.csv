Pregnancy Category for epilepsy and for manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder [see Warnings and Precautions 5.2, 5.3) ]. Pregnancy Category for prophylaxis of migraine headaches [see CONTRAINDICATIONS 4) ].Pregnancy RegistryTo collect information on the effects of in utero exposure to divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, physicians should encourage pregnant patients taking divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling toll free 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by the patients themselves. Information on the registry can be found at the website, http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Fetal Risk SummaryAll pregnancies have background risk of birth defects (about 3%), pregnancy loss (about 15%), or other adverse outcomes regardless of drug exposure. Maternal valproate use during pregnancy for any indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, but also malformations involving other body systems (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester; however, other serious developmental effects can occur with valproate use throughout pregnancy. The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to epileptic mothers who used valproate during pregnancy has been shown to be about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers who used other anti-seizure monotherapies [see Warnings and Precautions 5.3) ]. Several published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores than children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or to no antiepileptic drugs in utero [see Warnings and Precautions 5.3) ]. An observational study has suggested that exposure to valproate products during pregnancy may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorders. In this study, children born to mothers who had used valproate products during pregnancy had 2.9 times the risk (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7 to 4.9) of developing autism spectrum disorders compared to children born to mothers not exposed to valproate products during pregnancy. The absolute risks for autism spectrum disorders were 4.4% (95% CI: 2.6% to 7.5%) in valproate-exposed children and 1.5% (95% CI: 1.5% to 1.6%) in children not exposed to valproate products. Because the study was observational in nature, conclusions regarding causal association between in utero valproate exposure and an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder cannot be considered definitive. In animal studies, offspring with prenatal exposure to valproate had structural malformations similar to those seen in humans and demonstrated neurobehavioral deficits.Clinical ConsiderationsNeural tube defects are the congenital malformation most strongly associated with maternal valproate use. The risk of spina bifida following in utero valproate exposure is generally estimated as to 2%, compared to an estimated general population risk for spina bifida of about 0.06 to 0.07% (6 to in 10,000 births). Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores in children whose mothers were treated with valproate during pregnancy. Because of the risks of decreased IQ, neural tube defects, and other fetal adverse events, which may occur very early in pregnancy: Valproate should not be administered to woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition. This is especially important when valproate use is considered for condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death (e.g., migraine). Valproate is contraindicated during pregnancy in women being treated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches. Valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other treatments have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. In such women, the benefits of treatment with valproate during pregnancy may still outweigh the risks. When treating pregnant woman or woman of childbearing potential, carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment and provide appropriate counseling. To prevent major seizures, women with epilepsy should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life. Even minor seizures may pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus. However, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy in individual cases if the seizure disorder severity and frequency do not pose serious threat to the patient. Available prenatal diagnostic testing to detect neural tube and other defects should be offered to pregnant women using valproate. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population. It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation. Dietary folic acid supplementation both prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients using valproate. Pregnant women taking valproate may develop clotting abnormalities including thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and/or decrease in other coagulation factors, which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate including death [see Warnings and Precautions 5.8) ]. If valproate is used in pregnancy, the clotting parameters should be monitored carefully in the mother. If abnormal in the mother, then these parameters should also be monitored in the neonate. Patients taking valproate may develop hepatic failure [see BOXED WARNING and Warnings and Precautions 5.1) ]. Fatal cases of hepatic failure in infants exposed to valproate in utero have also been reported following maternal use of valproate during pregnancy. Hypoglycemia has been reported in neonates whose mothers have taken valproate during pregnancy. DataHumanThere is an extensive body of evidence demonstrating that exposure to valproate in utero increases the risk of neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities. Based on published data from the CDCs National Birth Defects Prevention Network, the risk of spina bifida in the general population is about 0.06 to 0.07%. The risk of spina bifida following in utero valproate exposure has been estimated to be approximately to 2%. The NAAED Pregnancy Registry has reported major malformation rate of to 11% in the offspring of women exposed to an average of 1,000 mg/day of valproate monotherapy during pregnancy. These data show up to five-fold increased risk for any major malformation following valproate exposure in utero compared to the risk following exposure in utero to other antiepileptic drugs taken in monotherapy. The major congenital malformations included cases of neural tube defects, cardiovascular malformations, craniofacial defects (e.g., oral clefts, craniosynostosis), hypospadias, limb malformations (e.g., clubfoot, polydactyly), and malformations of varying severity involving other body systems. Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores than children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or to no antiepileptic drugs in utero. The largest of these studies is prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n=62) had lower IQ scores at age (97 [95% C.I. 94 to 101]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other anti-epileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine (108 [95% C.I. 105 to 110]), carbamazepine (105 [95% C.I. 102 to 108]) and phenytoin (108 [95% C.I. 104 to 112]). It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproate-exposed children occur. Because the women in this study were exposed to antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed. Although all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports causal association between valproate exposure in utero and subsequent adverse effects on cognitive development. There are published case reports of fatal hepatic failure in offspring of women who used valproate during pregnancy.AnimalIn developmental toxicity studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys, increased rates of fetal structural abnormalities, intrauterine growth retardation, and embryo-fetal death occurred following treatment of pregnant animals with valproate during organogenesis at clinically relevant doses (calculated on body surface area basis). Valproate induced malformations of multiple organ systems, including skeletal, cardiac, and urogenital defects. In mice, in addition to other malformations, fetal neural tube defects have been reported following valproate administration during critical periods of organogenesis, and the teratogenic response correlated with peak maternal drug levels. Behavioral abnormalities (including cognitive, locomotor, and social interaction deficits) and brain histopathological changes have also been reported in mice and rat offspring exposed prenatally to clinically relevant doses of valproate.. Neural tube defects are the congenital malformation most strongly associated with maternal valproate use. The risk of spina bifida following in utero valproate exposure is generally estimated as to 2%, compared to an estimated general population risk for spina bifida of about 0.06 to 0.07% (6 to in 10,000 births). Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores in children whose mothers were treated with valproate during pregnancy. Because of the risks of decreased IQ, neural tube defects, and other fetal adverse events, which may occur very early in pregnancy: Valproate should not be administered to woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition.

Fatal cases of hepatic failure in infants exposed to valproate in utero have also been reported following maternal use of valproate during pregnancy. Hypoglycemia has been reported in neonates whose mothers have taken valproate during pregnancy. 8.3 Nursing Mothers. Valproate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when valproate is administered to nursing woman.. 8.4 Pediatric Use. Experience has indicated that pediatric patients under the age of two years are at considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions [see BOXED WARNING and Warnings and Precautions 5.1) ]. When valproate is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. Above the age of years, experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups. Younger children, especially those receiving enzyme inducing drugs, will require larger maintenance doses to attain targeted total and unbound valproate concentrations. Pediatric patients (i.e., between months and 10 years) have 50% higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e., mL/min/kg) than do adults. Over the age of 10 years, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults.The variability in free fraction limits the clinical usefulness of monitoring total serum valproic acid concentration. Interpretation of valproic acid concentrations in children should include consideration of factors that affect hepatic metabolism and protein binding.Pediatric Clinical TrialsDivalproex sodium delayed-release tablets were studied in seven pediatric clinical trials.Two of the pediatric studies were double-blinded placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets for the indications of mania (150 patients aged 10 to 17 years, 76 of whom were on divalproex sodium extended-release tablets) and migraine (304 patients aged 12 to 17 years, 231 of whom were on divalproex sodium extended-release tablets). Efficacy was not established for either the treatment of migraine or the treatment of mania. The most common drug-related adverse reactions (reported >5% and twice the rate of placebo) reported in the controlled pediatric mania study were nausea, upper abdominal pain, somnolence, increased ammonia, gastritis and rash.The remaining five trials were long term safety studies. Two six-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets for the indication of mania (292 patients aged 10 to 17 years). Two twelve-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets for the indication of migraine (353 patients aged 12 to 17 years). One twelve-month study was conducted to evaluate the safety of divalproex sodium delayed-release sprinkle capsules in the indication of partial seizures (169 patients aged to 10 years).In these seven clinical trials, the safety and tolerability of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients were shown to be comparable to those in adults [see ADVERSE REACTIONS 6) ]. Juvenile Animal ToxicologyIn studies of valproate in immature animals, toxic effects not observed in adult animals included retinal dysplasia in rats treated during the neonatal period (from postnatal day 4) and nephrotoxicity in rats treated during the neonatal and juvenile (from postnatal day 14) periods. The no-effect dose for these findings was less than the maximum recommended human dose on mg/m2 basis.. 8.5 Geriatric Use. No patients above the age of 65 years were enrolled in double-blind prospective clinical trials of mania associated with bipolar illness. In case review study of 583 patients, 72 patients (12%) were greater than 65 years of age. higher percentage of patients above 65 years of age reported accidental injury, infection, pain, somnolence, and tremor. Discontinuation of valproate was occasionally associated with the latter two events. It is not clear whether these events indicate additional risk or whether they result from preexisting medical illness and concomitant medication use among these patients.A study of elderly patients with dementia revealed drug related somnolence and discontinuation for somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions 5.14) ]. The starting dose should be reduced in these patients, and dosage reductions or discontinuation should be considered in patients with excessive somnolence [see Dosage and Administration 2.5) ]. There is insufficient information available to discern the safety and effectiveness of valproate for the prophylaxis of migraines in patients over 65.The capacity of elderly patients (age range: 68 to 89 years) to eliminate valproate has been shown to be reduced compared to younger adults (age range: 22 to 26 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.3) ]. 8.6 Effect of Disease. Liver Disease[(see BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5) and Clinical Pharmacology 12.3) ].

28343023,"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. Mechanism of Action. Lidocaine hydrochloride stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action.. Hemodynamics. Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to block of autonomic fibers, direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded.. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism. Information derived from diverse formulations, concentrations and usages reveals that lidocaine hydrochloride is completely absorbed following parenteral administration, its rate of absorption depending, for example, upon various factors such as the site of administration and the presence or absence of vasoconstrictor agent. Except for intravascular administration, the highest blood levels are obtained following intercostal nerve block and the lowest after subcutaneous administration. The plasma binding of lidocaine hydrochloride is dependent on drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of to mcg of free base per mL 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine hydrochloride is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine hydrochloride crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjugation. N-dealkylation, major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine hydrochloride. Approximately 90% of lidocaine hydrochloride administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylaniline. The elimination half-life of lidocaine hydrochloride following an intravenous bolus injection is typically 1.5 to hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine hydrochloride is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine hydrochloride kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine hydrochloride required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above mcg free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity.",32513e8b-2a81-436e-8da2-439c1dcbf116,34090-1,CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION

In human and animal studies, buspirone has shown no potential for abuse or diversion and there is no evidence that it causes tolerance, or either physical or psychological dependence. Human volunteers with history of recreational drug or alcohol usage were studied in two double-blind clinical investigations. None of the subjects were able to distinguish between buspirone hydrochloride tablets and placebo. By contrast, subjects showed statistically significant preference for methaqualone and diazepam. Studies in monkeys, mice, and rats have indicated that buspirone lacks potential for abuse.Following chronic administration in the rat, abrupt withdrawal of buspirone did not result in the loss of body weight commonly observed with substances that cause physical dependency.Although there is no direct evidence that buspirone hydrochloride tablets cause physical dependence or drug-seeking behavior, it is difficult to predict from experiments the extent to which CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of buspirone hydrochloride tablets misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behavior).",ea4fc29e-35f6-43ca-aeb1-f323b2d926f9,42227-9,DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE SECTION

(2.2, 8.6) Hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is needed. (8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk SummaryTranexamic acid tablets are not indicated for use in pregnant women. There are no available data on tranexamic acid tablets use in pregnant women to evaluate for drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Tranexamic acid crosses the placenta. Animal reproduction studies have not identified adverse developmental outcomes with oral administration of tranexamic acid to pregnant rats at doses up to times the recommended human dose (see Data).In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.DataAnimal DataIn rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, tranexamic acid had no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when administered during the period of organogenesis (from gestation days through 17) at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg (1, and times the recommended human oral dosage of 3,900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m2). In perinatal-postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats administered tranexamic acid from gestation day through postnatal day 20 at twice daily doses of 0, 150, 375, and 750 mg/kg, no significant adverse effects on maternal behavior or body weight were observed, and no significant effects on pup viability, body weight, developmental milestones or adult fertility were observed. It was concluded that the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for this study was 1,500 mg/kg/day in both F0 and F1 generations, which is equivalent to times the recommended human oral dose of 3,900 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m2). 8.2 Lactation. Risk SummaryTranexamic acid is present in the mothers milk at concentration of about one hundredth of the corresponding serum concentration (see Data). The amount of tranexamic acid nursing infant would absorb is unknown. There are no adequate data on the effects of tranexamic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects of tranexamic acid on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mothers clinical need for tranexamic acid tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from tranexamic acid tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. DataHuman DataOne hour after the last dose following 2-day treatment course in lactating women, the milk concentration of the tranexamic acid was 1% of the peak serum concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use. The safety and effectiveness of tranexamic acid tablets have been established in females of reproductive potential. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-menarchal females under the age of 17 as for those 17 years and older. Tranexamic acid tablets are not indicated before menarche. 8.5 Geriatric Use. Tranexamic acid tablets are indicated for females of reproductive potential and are not intended for use by postmenopausal women.. 8.6 Renal Impairment. The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid has not been studied. Because tranexamic acid is primarily eliminated via the kidneys by glomerular filtration with more than 95% excreted as unchanged in urine, the recommended dosage in patient with renal impairment is lower than the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid tablets has not been studied.

PREGNANCY CATEGORY DBenazepril hydrochloride tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue benazepril hydrochloride tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].. 5.2 Angioedema and Anaphylactoid Reactions. Angioedema Head and Neck Angioedema Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and/or larynx including some fatal reactions, have occured in patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride. Patients with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx are likely to experience airway obstruction, especially those with history of airway surgery. Benazepril hydrochloride should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms of angioedema has occurred.Patients with history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor [see Contraindications (4)]. ACE inhibitors have been associated with higher rate of angioedema in Black than in non-Black patients.Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy or neprilysin inhibitor may be at increased risk for angioedema [see Drug Interactions (7.7)]. Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has occurred in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. In some cases, the angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor.Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions.Anaphylactoid Reactions During Dialysis Sudden and potentially life threatening anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in some patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. In such patients, dialysis must be stopped immediately, and aggressive therapy for anaphylactoid reactions must be initiated. Symptoms have not been relieved by antihistamines in these situations. In these patients, consideration should be given to using different type of dialysis membrane or different class of antihypertensive agent. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption.. 5.3 Impaired Renal Function. Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride. Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin sytem. Patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, post-myocardial infarction, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on benazepril hydrochloride. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop clinically significant decrease in renal function on benazepril hydrochloride.. 5.4 Hypotension. Benazepril hydrochloride can cause symptomatic hypotension, sometimes complicated by oliguria, progressive azotemia, acute renal failure, or death. Patients at risk of excessive hypotension include those with the following conditions or characteristics: heart failure with systolic blood pressure below 100 mm Hg, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hyponatremia, high dose diuretic therapy, renal dialysis, or severe volume and/or salt depletion of any etiology.In such patients, follow closely for the first weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of benazepril or diuretic is increased. Avoid use of benazepril hydrochloride in patients who are hemodynamically unstable after acute MI.Surgery/Anesthesia In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, benazepril hydrochloride may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs, correct by volume expansion.. 5.5 Hyperkalemia. Serum potassium should be monitored periodically in patients receiving benazepril hydrochloride. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].. 5.6 Hepatic Failure. ACE inhibitors have been associated with syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up.",0653322d-70c6-45f7-a9d1-41efee1d7387,43685-7,WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION

Risk Summary Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is not indicated for use in women. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules in pregnant women. No adverse developmental effects were observed in animal studies in which tamsulosin hydrochloride was administered to rats or rabbits during the period of organogenesis (GD to 17 in the rat and GD to 18 in the rabbit) see Data] In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Administration of tamsulosin hydrochloride to pregnant female rats during the period of organogenesis at dose levels up to approximately 50 times the human therapeutic AUC exposure (300 mg/kg/day) revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus. Administration of tamsulosin hydrochloride to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at dose levels up to 50 mg/kg/day produced no evidence of fetal harm.. 8.2 Lactation. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is not indicated for use in women. There are no data on the presence of tamsulosin hydrochloride in human milk, the effects of tamsulosin hydrochloride on the breastfed infant, or the effects of tamsulosin hydrochloride on milk production. Tamsulosin hydrochloride is present in the milk of lactating rats see Data] Data Oral administration of radiolabeled tamsulosin hydrochloride to rats demonstrated that tamsulosin hydrochloride and/or its metabolites are excreted into the milk of rats.. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential. Infertility Males Abnormal ejaculation including ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease has been associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)] Studies in rats revealed significantly reduced fertility in males considered to be due to impairment of ejaculation, which was reversible see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] Females Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule is not indicated for use in women. Female fertility in rats was significantly reduced, considered to be due to impairment of fertilization see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are not indicated for use in pediatric populations.Efficacy and positive benefit/risk of tamsulosin hydrochloride was not demonstrated in two studies conducted in patients years to 16 years of age with elevated detrusor leak point pressure (>40 cm 2O) associated with known neurological disorder (e.g., spina bifida). Patients in both studies were treated on weight-based mg/kg schema (0.025 mg, 0.05 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, or 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride) for the reduction in detrusor leak point pressure below 40 cm 2O. In randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-week, pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy study in 161 patients, no statistically significant difference in the proportion of responders was observed between groups receiving tamsulosin hydrochloride and placebo. In an open-label, 12-month safety study, 87 patients were treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride. The most frequently reported adverse events (>=5%) from the pooled data of both studies were urinary tract infection, vomiting, pyrexia, headache, nasopharyngitis, cough, pharyngitis, influenza, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and constipation. 8.5 Geriatric Use. Of the total number of subjects (1783) in clinical studies of tamsulosin, 36% were 65 years of age and over.

28735487,"8.5 Geriatric Use. The total number of patients treated with gabapentin in controlled clinical trials in patients with postherpetic neuralgia was 336, of which 102 (30%) were 65 to 74 years of age, and 168 (50%) were 75 years of age and older. There was larger treatment effect in patients 75 years of age and older compared to younger patients who received the same dosage. Since gabapentin is almost exclusively eliminated by renal excretion, the larger treatment effect observed in patients >=75 years may be consequence of increased gabapentin exposure for given dose that results from an age-related decrease in renal function. However, other factors cannot be excluded. The types and incidence of adverse reactions were similar across age groups except for peripheral edema and ataxia, which tended to increase in incidence with age.Clinical studies of gabapentin in epilepsy did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and dose should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance values in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Adverse Reactions (6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",2278ce1b-1c19-4ad2-89c6-4530f7b78ea7,34082-8,GERIATRIC USE SECTION
28274969,"8.4 Pediatric Use The effects of ezetimibe coadministered with simvastatin (n=126) compared to simvastatin monotherapy (n=122) have been evaluated in adolescent boys and girls with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). In multicenter, double-blind, controlled study followed by an open-label phase, 142 boys and 106 postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age (mean age 14.2 years, 43% females, 82% Caucasians, 4% Asian, 2% Blacks, 13% multi-racial) with HeFH were randomized to receive either ezetimibe coadministered with simvastatin or simvastatin monotherapy. Inclusion in the study required 1) baseline LDL-C level between 160 and 400 mg/dL and 2) medical history and clinical presentation consistent with HeFH. The mean baseline LDL-C value was 225 mg/dL (range: 161 to 351 mg/dL) in the ezetimibe coadministered with simvastatin group compared to 219 mg/dL (range: 149 to 336 mg/dL) in the simvastatin monotherapy group. The patients received coadministered ezetimibe and simvastatin (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg) or simvastatin monotherapy (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg) for weeks, coadministered ezetimibe and 40 mg simvastatin or 40 mg simvastatin monotherapy for the next 27 weeks, and open-label coadministered ezetimibe and simvastatin (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg) for 20 weeks thereafter. The results of the study at Week are summarized in Table 3. Results at Week 33 were consistent with those at Week 6.TABLE 3: Mean Percent Difference at Week Between the Pooled Ezetimibe Coadministered with Simvastatin Group and the Pooled Simvastatin Monotherapy Group in Adolescent Patients with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia Total-C LDL-C Apo Non-HDL-C TG HDL-C Mean percent difference between treatment groups -12% -15% -12% -14% -2% +0.1% 95% Confidence Interval (-15%, -9%) (-18%, -12%) (-15%, -9%) (-17%, -11%) (-9%, +4%) (-3%, +3%) For triglycerides, median change from baselineFrom the start of the trial to the end of Week 33, discontinuations due to an adverse reaction occurred in (6%) patients in the ezetimibe coadministered with simvastatin group and in (2%) patients in the simvastatin monotherapy group. During the trial, hepatic transaminase elevations (two consecutive measurements for ALT and/or AST greater than or equal to X ULN) occurred in four (3%) individuals in the ezetimibe coadministered with simvastatin group and in two (2%) individuals in the simvastatin monotherapy group. Elevations of CPK (greater than or equal to 10 ULN) occurred in two (2%) individuals in the ezetimibe coadministered with simvastatin group and in zero individuals in the simvastatin monotherapy group. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in the adolescent boys or girls, or on menstrual cycle length in girls. Coadministration of ezetimibe with simvastatin at doses greater than 40 mg/day has not been studied in adolescents. Also, ezetimibe has not been studied in patients younger than 10 years of age or in pre-menarchal girls. Based on total ezetimibe (ezetimibe ezetimibe-glucuronide), there are no pharmacokinetic differences between adolescents and adults.

In 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats given daily oral doses of the prodrug oseltamivir phosphate up to 400 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg, respectively, the prodrug and the active form oseltamivir carboxylate induced no statistically significant increases in tumors over controls. The mean maximum daily exposures to the prodrug in mice and rats were approximately 130- and 320-fold, respectively, greater than those in humans at the recommended clinical dose based on AUC comparisons. The respective safety margins of the exposures to the active oseltamivir carboxylate were 15- and 50-fold. Oseltamivir was found to be non-mutagenic in the Ames test and the human lymphocyte chromosome assay with and without enzymatic activation and negative in the mouse micronucleus test. It was found to be positive in Syrian Hamster Embryo (SHE) cell transformation test. Oseltamivir carboxylate was non-mutagenic in the Ames test and the L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay with and without enzymatic activation and negative in the SHE cell transformation test. In fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, doses of oseltamivir at 50, 250, and 1,500 mg/kg/day were administered to females for weeks before mating, during mating and until day of pregnancy. Males were dosed for weeks before mating, during mating, and for weeks after mating. There were no effects on fertility, mating performance or early embryonic development at any dose level.

It is not active against most strains of Enterobacter spp., Morganella morganii, and Proteus vulgaris. It has no activity against Pseudomonas spp. or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae is usually cross-resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics.. Susceptibility Tests. Dilution techniques:. Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on dilution method1-3 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of cephalothin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:MIC (mcg/mL)Interpretation<=8 Susceptible (S) 16 Intermediate (I)>=32 Resistant (R)A report of Susceptible indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. report of Intermediate indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. report of Resistant indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard cephalothin powder should provide the following MIC values:MicroorganismMIC (mcg/mL)E. coli ATCC 259224-16S. aureus ATCC 292130.12-0.5. Diffusion techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure 2,3 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30-mcg cephalothin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to cephalexin.Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with 30-mcg cephalothin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:Zone Diameter (mm)Interpretation>=18 Susceptible (S) 15-17 Intermediate (I) <=14 Resistant (R) Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for cephalexin.As with standard dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 30-mcg cephalothin disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains:MicroorganismZone Diameter (mm) E. coli ATCC 2592215-21 S. aureus ATCC 25923 29-37.",cb31cd1b-100d-4a24-b314-1ddcd6a95314,49489-8,MICROBIOLOGY SECTION

Carcinogenesis An increase in urinary bladder tumors was observed in mice given topiramate (0, 20, 75, and 300 mg/kg/day) in the diet for 21 months. The increase in the incidence of bladder tumors in males and females receiving 300 mg/kg/day was primarily due to the increased occurrence of smooth muscle tumor considered histomorphologically unique to mice. The higher of the doses not associated with an increase in tumors (75 mg/kg/day) is equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) for epilepsy (400 mg), and approximately times the MRHD for migraine (100 mg) on mg/m2 basis. The relevance of this finding to human carcinogenic risk is uncertain. No evidence of carcinogenicity was seen in rats following oral administration of topiramate for years at doses up to 120 mg/kg/day (approximately times the MRHD for epilepsy and 12 times the MRHD for migraine on mg/m basis). Mutagenesis Topiramate did not demonstrate genotoxic potential when tested in battery of in vitro and in vivo assays. Topiramate was not mutagenic in the Ames test or the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay; it did not increase unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes in vitro; and it did not increase chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes in vitro or in rat bone marrow in vivo. Impairment of Fertility No adverse effects on male or female fertility were observed in rats administered topiramate orally at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the MRHD for epilepsy and 10 times the MRHD for migraine on mg/m basis) prior to and during mating and early pregnancy.",b5fb741b-b13f-4ef2-9edc-2d4102efe056,43680-8,NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY SECTION

Early Treatment: During the early phase of definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, initiate treatment with metoprolol as soon as possible after the patients arrival in the hospital. Such treatment should be initiated in coronary care or similar unit immediately after the patients hemodynamic condition has stabilized. Begin treatment in this early phase with the intravenous administration of three bolus injections of mg of metoprolol each; give the injections at approximately 2-minute intervals. During the intravenous administration of metoprolol, monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram. In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (15 mg), initiate metoprolol tablets, 50 mg every hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose and continue for 48 hours. Thereafter, the maintenance dosage is 100 mg orally twice daily. Start patients who appear not to tolerate the full intravenous dose on metoprolol tablets either 25 mg or 50 mg every hours (depending on the degree of intolerance) 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose or as soon as their clinical condition allows.

Physical dependence is state that develops as result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or significant dose reduction of drug. There are rare postmarketing reports of individuals experiencing withdrawal symptoms shortly after discontinuing higher than recommended doses of gabapentin used to treat illnesses for which the drug is not approved. Such symptoms included agitation, disorientation and confusion after suddenly discontinuing gabapentin that resolved after restarting gabapentin. The dependence potential of gabapentin has not been evaluated in human studies.",b4954172-5439-48fd-8348-8a2e0d2fee62,34087-7,DEPENDENCE SECTION
28044324,"14 CLINICAL STUDIES. 14.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women. Daily DosingThe efficacy of alendronate 10 mg daily was assessed in four clinical trials. Study 1, three-year, multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled, U.S. clinical study enrolled 478 patients with BMD T-score at or below minus 2.5 with or without prior vertebral fracture; Study 2, three-year, multicenter, double-blind placebo controlled Multinational clinical study enrolled 516 patients with BMD T-score at or below minus 2.5 with or without prior vertebral fracture; Study 3, the Three-Year Study of the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) study which enrolled 2027 postmenopausal patients with at least one baseline vertebral fracture; and Study 4, the Four-Year Study of FIT: study which enrolled 4432 postmenopausal patients with low bone mass but without baseline vertebral fracture.Effect on Fracture IncidenceTo assess the effects of alendronate sodium on the incidence of vertebral fractures (detected by digitized radiography; approximately one third of these were clinically symptomatic), the U.S. and Multinational studies were combined in an analysis that compared placebo to the pooled dosage groups of alendronate (5 or 10 mg for three years or 20 mg for two years followed by mg for one year). There was statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients treated with alendronate sodium experiencing one or more new vertebral fractures relative to those treated with placebo (3.2% vs. 6.2%; 48% relative risk reduction). reduction in the total number of new vertebral fractures (4.2 vs. 11.3 per 100 patients) was also observed. In the pooled analysis, patients who received alendronate sodium had loss in stature that was statistically significantly less than was observed in those who received placebo (-3 mm vs. -4.6 mm).The Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) consisted of two studies in postmenopausal women: the Three-Year Study of patients who had at least one baseline radiographic vertebral fracture and the Four-Year Study of patients with low bone mass but without baseline vertebral fracture. In both studies of FIT, 96% of randomized patients completed the studies (i.e., had closeout visit at the scheduled end of the study); approximately 80% of patients were still taking study medication upon completion.Fracture Intervention Trial: Three-Year Study (patients with at least one baseline radiographic vertebral fracture)This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2027-patient study (alendronate sodium, n=1022; placebo, n=1005) demonstrated that treatment with alendronate sodium resulted in statistically significant reductions in fracture incidence at three years as shown in Table 6.Table 6: Effect of Alendronate Sodium on Fracture Incidence in the Three-Year Study of FIT (patients with vertebral fracture at baseline) Percent of PatientsAlendronate Sodium (n=1022)Placebo (n=1005)Absolute Reductionin Fracture IncidenceRelative Reductionin FractureRisk %Number evaluable for vertebral fractures: alendronate sodium, n=984; placebo, n=966 +p<0.001, p=0.007, p<0.01, p<0.05 Patients with: Vertebral fractures (diagnosed by X-ray) >=1 new vertebral fracture 7.9 15 7.1 47+ >=2 new vertebral fractures 0.5 4.9 4.4 90+ Clinical (symptomatic)fractures Any clinical (symptomatic) fracture 13.8 18.1 4.3 26 >=1 clinical (symptomatic)vertebral fracture 2.3 2.7 54 Hip fracture 1.1 2.2 1.1 51 Wrist (forearm) fracture 2.2 4.1 1.9 48 Furthermore, in this population of patients with baseline vertebral fracture, treatment with alendronate sodium significantly reduced the incidence of hospitalizations (25% vs. 30.7%). In the Three-Year Study of FIT, fractures of the hip occurred in 22 (2.2%) of 1005 patients on placebo and 11 (1.1%) of 1022 patients on alendronate sodium, p=0.047. Figure displays the cumulative incidence of hip fractures in this study. Figure 1:Fracture Intervention Trial: Four-Year Study (patients with low bone mass but without baseline radiographic vertebral fracture)This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4432-patient study (alendronate sodium, n=2214; placebo, n=2218) further investigated the reduction in fracture incidence due to alendronate sodium. The intent of the study was to recruit women with osteoporosis, defined as baseline femoral neck BMD at least two standard deviations below the mean for young adult women. However, due to subsequent revisions to the normative values for femoral neck BMD, 31% of patients were found not to meet this entry criterion and thus this study included both osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic women. The results are shown in Table for the patients with osteoporosis.Table 7: Effect of Alendronate Sodium on Fracture Incidence in Osteoporotic Patients in the Four-Year Study of FIT (patients without vertebral fracture at baseline) Percent of PatientsAlendronate Sodium (n=1545)Placebo(n=1521)AbsoluteReductionin FractureIncidenceRelativeReductionin FractureRisk (%) Baseline femoral neck BMD at least SD below the mean for young adult women Number evaluable for vertebral fractures: alendronate sodium, n=1426; placebo, n=1428 p<0.001, p=0.035, p=0.01 Not significant.

In the Four-Year Study of FIT, alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of osteoporotic women experiencing multiple vertebral fractures from 0.6% to 0.1% (78% relative risk reduction, p=0.035).Thus, alendronate sodium reduced the incidence of radiographic vertebral fractures in osteoporotic women whether or not they had previous radiographic vertebral fracture.Effect on Bone Mineral Density The bone mineral density efficacy of alendronate 10 mg once daily in postmenopausal women, 44 to 84 years of age, with osteoporosis (lumbar spine bone mineral density [BMD] of at least standard deviations below the premenopausal mean) was demonstrated in four double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies of two or three years duration. Figure shows the mean increases in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in patients receiving alendronate 10 mg/day relative to placebo-treated patients at three years for each of these studies. Figure 2: At three years significant increases in BMD, relative both to baseline and placebo, were seen at each measurement site in each study in patients who received alendronate 10 mg/day. Total body BMD also increased significantly in each study, suggesting that the increases in bone mass of the spine and hip did not occur at the expense of other skeletal sites. Increases in BMD were evident as early as three months and continued throughout the three years of treatment. (See Figure for lumbar spine results.) In the two-year extension of these studies, treatment of 147 patients with alendronate 10 mg/day resulted in continued increases in BMD at the lumbar spine and trochanter (absolute additional increases between years and 5: lumbar spine, 0.94%; trochanter, 0.88%). BMD at the femoral neck, forearm and total body were maintained. Alendronate sodium was similarly effective regardless of age, race, baseline rate of bone turnover, and baseline BMD in the range studied (at least standard deviations below the premenopausal mean). Figure 3: In patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis treated with alendronate 10 mg/day for one or two years, the effects of treatment withdrawal were assessed. Following discontinuation, there were no further increases in bone mass and the rates of bone loss were similar to those of the placebo groups.Bone Histology Bone histology in 270 postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis treated with alendronate at doses ranging from to 20 mg/day for one, two, or three years revealed normal mineralization and structure, as well as the expected decrease in bone turnover relative to placebo. These data, together with the normal bone histology and increased bone strength observed in rats and baboons exposed to long-term alendronate treatment, support the conclusion that bone formed during therapy with alendronate sodium is of normal quality.Effect on Height Alendronate sodium, over three- or four-year period, was associated with statistically significant reductions in loss of height vs. placebo in patients with and without baseline radiographic vertebral fractures. At the end of the FIT studies the between-treatment group differences were 3.2 mm in the Three-Year Study and 1.3 mm in the Four-Year Study. Weekly Dosing The therapeutic equivalence of once weekly alendronate 70 mg (n=519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n=370) was demonstrated in one-year, double-blind, multicenter study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. In the primary analysis of completers, the mean increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at one year were 5.1% (4.8, 5.4%; 95% CI) in the 70 mg once-weekly group (n=440) and 5.4% (5, 5.8%; 95% CI) in the 10 mg daily group (n=330). The two treatment groups were also similar with regard to BMD increases at other skeletal sites. The results of the intention-to-treat analysis were consistent with the primary analysis of completers. Concomitant Use with Estrogen/Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) The effects on BMD of treatment with alendronate 10 mg once daily and conjugated estrogen (0.625 mg/day) either alone or in combination were assessed in two-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of hysterectomized postmenopausal osteoporotic women (n=425). At two years, the increases in lumbar spine BMD from baseline were significantly greater with the combination (8.3%) than with either estrogen or alendronate sodium alone (both 6%). The effects on BMD when alendronate sodium was added to stable doses (for at least one year) of HRT (estrogen +- progestin) were assessed in one-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in postmenopausal osteoporotic women (n=428). The addition of alendronate 10 mg once daily to HRT produced, at one year, significantly greater increases in lumbar spine BMD (3.7%) vs. HRT alone (1.1%). In these studies, significant increases or favorable trends in BMD for combined therapy compared with HRT alone were seen at the total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter. No significant effect was seen for total body BMD. Histomorphometric studies of transiliac biopsies in 92 subjects showed normal bone architecture. Compared to placebo there was 98% suppression of bone turnover (as assessed by mineralizing surface) after 18 months of combined treatment with alendronate sodium and HRT, 94% on alendronate sodium alone, and 78% on HRT alone. The long-term effects of combined alendronate sodium and HRT on fracture occurrence and fracture healing have not been studied.. Figure 1. Figure 2. Figure 3. 14.2 Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women. Daily DosingPrevention of bone loss was demonstrated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of postmenopausal women 40 to 60 years of age. One thousand six hundred nine patients (alendronate mg/day; n=498) who were at least six months postmenopausal were entered into two-year study without regard to their baseline BMD. In the other study, 447 patients (alendronate mg/day; n=88), who were between six months and three years postmenopause, were treated for up to three years. In the placebo-treated patients BMD losses of approximately 1% per year were seen at the spine, hip (femoral neck and trochanter) and total body. In contrast, alendronate mg/day prevented bone loss in the majority of patients and induced significant increases in mean bone mass at each of these sites (see Figure 4). In addition, alendronate mg/day reduced the rate of bone loss at the forearm by approximately half relative to placebo. Alendronate mg/day was similarly effective in this population regardless of age, time since menopause, race and baseline rate of bone turnover.Figure 4: Bone Histology Bone histology was normal in the 28 patients biopsied at the end of three years who received alendronate at doses of up to 10 mg/day. Weekly Dosing The therapeutic equivalence of once weekly alendronate 35 mg (n=362) and alendronate mg daily (n=361) was demonstrated in one-year, double-blind, multicenter study of postmenopausal women without osteoporosis. In the primary analysis of completers, the mean increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at one year were 2.9% (2.6, 3.2%; 95% CI) in the 35 mg once-weekly group (n=307) and 3.2% (2.9, 3.5%; 95% CI) in the mg daily group (n=298). The two treatment groups were also similar with regard to BMD increases at other skeletal sites. The results of the intention-to-treat analysis were consistent with the primary analysis of completers.. Figure 4. 14.3 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Osteoporosis. The efficacy of alendronate sodium in men with hypogonadal or idiopathic osteoporosis was demonstrated in two clinical studies. Daily Dosing two-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of alendronate 10 mg once daily enrolled total of 241 men between the ages of 31 and 87 (mean, 63). All patients in the trial had either BMD T-score less than or equal to -2 at the femoral neck and less than or equal to -1 at the lumbar spine, or baseline osteoporotic fracture and BMD T-score less than or equal to -1 at the femoral neck. At two years, the mean increases relative to placebo in BMD in men receiving alendronate 10 mg/day were significant at the following sites: lumbar spine, 5.3%; femoral neck, 2.6%; trochanter, 3.1%; and total body, 1.6%. Treatment with alendronate sodium also reduced height loss (alendronate sodium, -0.6 mm vs. placebo, -2.4 mm). Weekly Dosing one-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of once weekly alendronate 70 mg enrolled total of 167 men between the ages of 38 and 91 (mean, 66). Patients in the study had either BMD T-score less than or equal to -2 at the femoral neck and less than or equal to -1 at the lumbar spine, or BMD T-score less than or equal to -2 at the lumbar spine and less than or equal to -1 at the femoral neck, or baseline osteoporotic fracture and BMD T-score less than or equal to -1 at the femoral neck. At one year, the mean increases relative to placebo in BMD in men receiving alendronate 70 mg once weekly were significant at the following sites: lumbar spine, 2.8%; femoral neck, 1.9%; trochanter, 2%; and total body, 1.2%. These increases in BMD were similar to those seen at one year in the 10 mg once-daily study. In both studies, BMD responses were similar regardless of age (greater than or equal to 65 years vs. less than 65 years), gonadal function (baseline testosterone less than ng/dL vs. greater than or equal to ng/dL), or baseline BMD (femoral neck and lumbar spine T-score less than or equal to -2.5 vs. greater than -2.5).. 14.4 Treatment of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis. The efficacy of alendronate and 10 mg once daily in men and women receiving glucocorticoids (at least 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) was demonstrated in two, one-year, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies of virtually identical design, one performed in the United States and the other in 15 different countries (Multinational [which also included alendronate 2.5 mg/day]). These studies enrolled 232 and 328 patients, respectively, between the ages of 17 and 83 with variety of glucocorticoid-requiring diseases. Patients received supplemental calcium and vitamin D. Figure shows the mean increases relative to placebo in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in patients receiving alendronate mg/day for each study. Figure 5:After one year, significant increases relative to placebo in BMD were seen in the combined studies at each of these sites in patients who received alendronate mg/day. In the placebo-treated patients, significant decrease in BMD occurred at the femoral neck (-1.2%), and smaller decreases were seen at the lumbar spine and trochanter. Total body BMD was maintained with alendronate mg/day. The increases in BMD with alendronate 10 mg/day were similar to those with alendronate mg/day in all patients except for postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen therapy. In these women, the increases (relative to placebo) with alendronate 10 mg/day were greater than those with alendronate mg/day at the lumbar spine (4.1% vs. 1.6%) and trochanter (2.8% vs. 1.7%), but not at other sites. Alendronate sodium was effective regardless of dose or duration of glucocorticoid use. In addition, alendronate sodium was similarly effective regardless of age (less than 65 vs. greater than or equal to 65 years), race (Caucasian vs. other races), gender, underlying disease, baseline BMD, baseline bone turnover, and use with variety of common medications. Bone histology was normal in the 49 patients biopsied at the end of one year who received alendronate at doses of up to 10 mg/day. Of the original 560 patients in these studies, 208 patients who remained on at least 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent continued into one-year double-blind extension. After two years of treatment, spine BMD increased by 3.7% and 5% relative to placebo with alendronate and 10 mg/day, respectively. Significant increases in BMD (relative to placebo) were also observed at the femoral neck, trochanter, and total body. After one year, 2.3% of patients treated with alendronate or 10 mg/day (pooled) vs. 3.7% of those treated with placebo experienced new vertebral fracture (not significant). However, in the population studied for two years, treatment with alendronate (pooled dosage groups: or 10 mg for two years or 2.5 mg for one year followed by 10 mg for one year) significantly reduced the incidence of patients with new vertebral fracture (alendronate 0.7% vs. placebo 6.8%).. Figure 5. 14.5 Treatment of Pagets Disease of Bone. The efficacy of alendronate 40 mg once daily for six months was demonstrated in two double-blind clinical studies of male and female patients with moderate to severe Pagets disease (alkaline phosphatase at least twice the upper limit of normal): placebo-controlled, multinational study and U.S. comparative study with etidronate disodium 400 mg/day. Figure shows the mean percent changes from baseline in serum alkaline phosphatase for up to six months of randomized treatment. Figure 6:At six months the suppression in alkaline phosphatase in patients treated with alendronate sodium was significantly greater than that achieved with etidronate and contrasted with the complete lack of response in placebo-treated patients. Response (defined as either normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase or decrease from baseline greater than or equal to 60%) occurred in approximately 85% of patients treated with alendronate sodium in the combined studies vs. 30% in the etidronate group and 0% in the placebo group. Alendronate sodium was similarly effective regardless of age, gender, race, prior use of other bisphosphonates, or baseline alkaline phosphatase within the range studied (at least twice the upper limit of normal). Bone histology was evaluated in 33 patients with Pagets disease treated with alendronate 40 mg/day for months. As in patients treated for osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], alendronate sodium did not impair mineralization, and the expected decrease in the rate of bone turnover was observed. Normal lamellar bone was produced during treatment with alendronate sodium, even where preexisting bone was woven and disorganized. Overall, bone histology data support the conclusion that bone formed during treatment with alendronate sodium is of normal quality..

Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).After observing the response to initial therapy with ibuprofen tablets the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patients needs.Do not exceed 3200 mg total daily dose. If gastrointestinal complaints occur, administer Ibuprofen Tablets, USP with meals or milk.Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, including flare-ups of chronic disease:Suggested Dosage: 1200 mg-3200 mg daily (300 mg qid; 400 mg, 600 mg or 800 mg tid or qid).Individual patients may show better response to 3200 mg daily, as compared with 2400 mg, although in well-controlled clinical trials patients on 3200 mg did not show better mean response in terms of efficacy. Therefore, when treating patients with 3200 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset potential increased risk.The dose should be tailored to each patient, and may be lowered or raised depending on the severity of symptoms either at time of initiating drug therapy or as the patient responds or fails to respond.In general, patients with rheumatoid arthritis seem to require higher doses of ibuprofen tablets than do patients with osteoarthritis.The smallest dose of ibuprofen tablets that yields acceptable control should be employed. linear blood level dose-response relationship exists with single doses up to 800 mg (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for effects of food on rate of absorption). The availability of four tablet strengths facilitates dosage adjustment.In chronic conditions, therapeutic response to therapy with ibuprofen tablets is sometimes seen in few days to week but most often is observed by two weeks. After satisfactory response has been achieved, the patients dose should be reviewed and adjusted as required.Mild to moderate pain: 400 mg every to hours as necessary for relief of pain.In controlled analgesic clinical trials, doses of ibuprofen tablets greater than 400 mg were no more effective than the 400 mg dose.Dysmenorrhea: For the treatment of dysmenorrhea, beginning with the earliest onset of such pain, ibuprofen tablets should be given in dose of 400 mg every hours as necessary for the relief of pain.",7b0f3f87-751a-4cc3-9b9a-95bedfd7c5e0,34068-7,DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION SECTION

The risk of dependence increases with dose and duration of treatment. The risk of abuse and dependence is also greater in patients with history of alcohol or drug abuse. Zolpidem Tartrate Capsules should be used with extreme caution in patients with current or past alcohol or drug abuse.Physical dependence is state that develops as result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or significant dose reduction of drug.Tolerance is physiological state characterized by reduced response to drug after repeated administration (i.e., higher dose of drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at lower dose).Sedative/hypnotics have produced withdrawal signs and symptoms following abrupt discontinuation. These reported symptoms range from mild dysphoria and insomnia to withdrawal syndrome that may include abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, tremors, convulsions, and delirium.The following adverse reactions, which are considered to meet the DSM-III-R criteria for uncomplicated sedative/hypnotic withdrawal, were reported during clinical trials with another zolpidem tartrate immediate-release product following placebo substitution occurring within 48 hours following last zolpidem treatment: fatigue, nausea, flushing, lightheadedness, uncontrolled crying, emesis, stomach cramps, panic attack, nervousness, and abdominal discomfort.

28827434,"12.3 Pharmacokinetics. Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metformin hydrochloride 500 mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride 500 to 1,500 mg and 850 to 2,550 mg, indicate that there is lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin hydrochloride, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally <1 ug/mL.Effect of food: Food decreases the extent of absorption and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax), 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) following administration of single 850 mg tablet of metformin hydrochloride with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting.Distribution The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride 850 mg averaged 654 +- 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as function of time.Metabolism Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion.Elimination Renal clearance (see Table 4) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be compartment of distribution.Specific PopulationsRenal Impairment In patients with decreased renal function the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased (see Table 3) [See Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].Geriatrics Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin hydrochloride in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and Cmax is increased, compared to healthy young subjects.

28706772,"CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS. Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events. Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs.The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as ibuprofen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see WARNINGS). Status Post Coronary Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years to follow-up. Avoid the use of Ibuprofen in patients with recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If Ibuprofen is used in patients with recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.. Hypertension. NSAIDs including IBU tablets, can lead to onset of new hypertensionor worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which maycontribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients takingthiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapieswhen taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including IBU tablets, should beused with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP)should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatmentand throughout the course of therapy.. Heart Failure and Edema. The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trails demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of ibuprofen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions [e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] [See DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Avoid the use of IBU tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If IBU tablets is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. Gastrointestinal Effects Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation. NSAIDs, including IBU tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal(GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patientstreated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for oneyear. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in thosewith prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.Patients with prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing GI bleed compared to patients treatedwith neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the riskof GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GIulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if serious GI event is suspected.This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.. Renal Effects. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of NSAID may cause dose dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest riskof this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure,liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.. Advanced Renal Disease. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of Ibuprofen tablets in patients with advanced renal disease.Therefore, treatment with IBU tablets is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If IBU tablet therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patients renal function is advisable.. Anaphylactoid Reactions. As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur inpatients without known prior exposure to IBU tablets. IBU tablets should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Preexisting Asthma) .Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoidreaction occurs. Skin Reactions. NSAIDs, including IBU tablets, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome(SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal.These serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.. Pregnancy. In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, IBU tablets should beavoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.",575c275c-3e1a-0572-e053-2991aa0adabd,42229-5,SPL UNCLASSIFIED SECTION

Amphetamines may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or vehicles; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with dextroamphetamine and should counsel them in its appropriate use. patient Medication Guide is available for Dextroamphetamine Sulfate Extended Release Capsules. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.Circulation problems in fingers and toes [Peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynauds phenomenon]Instruct patients beginning treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate about the risk of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynauds phenomenon, and associated signs and symptoms: fingers or toes may feel numb, cool, painful, and/or may change color from pale, to blue, to red.Instruct patients to report to their physician any new numbness, pain, skin color change, or sensitivity to temperature in fingers or toes.Instruct patients to call their physician immediately with any signs of unexplained wounds appearing on fingers or toes while taking dextroamphetamine sulfate.Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients..

Instruct patients to call their physician immediately with any signs of unexplained wounds appearing on fingers or toes while taking dextroamphetamine sulfate.. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.. Drug Interactions. Acidifying Agents. Lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines. Increase dose based on clinical response. Examples of acidifying agents include gastrointestinal acidifying agents (e.g., guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid) and urinary acidifying agents (e.g., ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, methenamine salts).. Adrenergic Blockers. Adrenergic blockers are inhibited by amphetamines.. Alkalinizing Agents. Increase blood levels and potentiate the action of amphetamine. Co-administration of dextroamphetamine sulfate and gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents should be avoided. Examples of alkalinizing agents include gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (e.g., sodium bicarbonate) and urinary alkalinizing agents (e.g. acetazolamide, some thiazides).. TricyclicAntidepressants. May enhance the activity of tricyclic or sympathomimetic agents causing striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain; cardiovascular effects can be potentiated. Monitor frequently and adjust or use alternative therapy based on clinical response. Examples of tricyclic antidepressants include desipramine, Protriptyline.. CYP2D6Inhibitors. The concomitant use of dextroamphetamine sulfate and CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase the exposure of dextroamphetamine sulfate compared to the use of the drug alone and increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. Initiate with lower doses and monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome particularly during dextroamphetamine sulfate initiation and after dosage increase. If serotonin syndrome occurs, discontinue dextroamphetamine sulfate and the CYP2D6 inhibitor [see Warnings, Overdosage]. Examples of CYP2D6 Inhibitors include paroxetine and fluoxetine (also serotonergic drugs), quinidine, ritonavir.. SerotonergicDrugs. The concomitant use of dextroamphetamine sulfate and serotonergic drugs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Initiate with lower doses and monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during dextroamphetamine sulfate initiation or dosage increase. If serotonin syndrome occurs, discontinue dextroamphetamine sulfate and the concomitant serotonergic drug(s) [see Warnings and Precautions]. Examples of serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, St. Johns Wort.. MAO Inhibitors. Concomitant use of MAOIs and CNS stimulants can cause hypertensive crisis. Potential outcomes include death, stroke, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, ophthalmological complications, eclampsia, pulmonary edema, and renal failure. Do not administer dextroamphetamine sulfate concomitantly or within 14 days after discontinuing MAOI [see Contraindications and Warnings]. Examples of MAOIs include selegiline, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, linezolid, methylene blue.. Proton PumpInhibitors. Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of amphetamine is decreased compared to when administered alone. Monitor patients for changes in clinical effect and adjust therapy based on clinical response. An example of proton pump inhibitor is omeprazole.. Antihistamines. Amphetamines may counteract the sedative effect of antihistamines.. Antihypertensives. Amphetamines may antagonize the hypotensive effects of antihypertensives.. Chlorpromazine. Chlorpromazine blocks dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines, and can be used to treat amphetamine poisoning.. Ethosuximide. Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of ethosuximide.. Haloperidol. Haloperidol blocks dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines.. Lithium Carbonate. The stimulatory effects of amphetamines may be inhibited by lithium carbonate.. Meperidine. Amphetamines potentiate the analgesic effect of meperidine.. Methenamine Therapy. Urinary excretion of amphetamines is increased, and efficacy is reduced, by acidifying agents used in methenamine therapy.. Norepinephrine. Amphetamines enhance the adrenergic effect of norepinephrine.. Phenobarbital. Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenobarbital; co-administration of phenobarbital may produce synergistic anticonvulsant action.. Phenytoin. Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenytoin; co-administration of phenytoin may produce synergistic anticonvulsant action.. Propoxyphene. In cases of propoxyphene overdosage, amphetamine CNS stimulation is potentiated and fatal convulsions can occur.. Veratrum Alkaloids. Amphetamines inhibit the hypotensive effect of veratrum alkaloids.. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions. Amphetamines can cause significant elevation in plasma corticosteroid levels. This increase is greatest in the evening.Amphetamines may interfere with urinary steroid determinations.. Carcinogenesis/Mutagenesis. Mutagenicity studies and long-term studies in animals to determine the carcinogenic potential of dextroamphetamine sulfate have not been performed.. Pregnancy. Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C. Dextroamphetamine sulfate has been shown to have embryotoxic and teratogenic effects when administered to A/Jax mice and C57BL mice in doses approximately 41 times the maximum human dose. Embryotoxic effects were not seen in New Zealand white rabbits given the drug in doses times the human dose nor in rats given 12.5 times the maximum human dose. While there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, there has been report of severe congenital bony deformity, tracheoesophageal fistula, and anal atresia (VATER association) in baby born to woman who took dextroamphetamine sulfate with lovastatin during the first trimester of pregnancy. Dextroamphetamine sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.. Nonteratogenic Effects. Infants born to mothers dependent on amphetamines have an increased risk of premature delivery and low birth weight. Also, these infants may experience symptoms of withdrawal as demonstrated by dysphoria, including agitation, and significant lassitude.. Nursing Mothers. Amphetamines are excreted in human milk. Mothers taking amphetamines should be advised to refrain from nursing.. Pediatric Use. Long-term effects of amphetamines in pediatric patients have not been well established.Dextroamphetamine sulfate is not recommended for use in pediatric patients younger than years of age with Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity described under INDICATIONS AND USAGE.Clinical experience suggests that in psychotic children, administration of amphetamines may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder.Amphetamines have been reported to exacerbate motor and phonic tics and Tourettes syndrome. Therefore, clinical evaluation for tics and Tourettes syndrome in children and their families should precede use of stimulant medications.Data are inadequate to determine whether chronic administration of amphetamines may be associated with growth inhibition; therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment.Drug treatment is not indicated in all cases of Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity and should be considered only in light of the complete history and evaluation of the child. The decision to prescribe amphetamines should depend on the physicians assessment of the chronicity and severity of the childs symptoms and their appropriateness for his or her age. Prescription should not depend solely on the presence of one or more of the behavioral characteristics.When these symptoms are associated with acute stress reactions, treatment with amphetamines is usually not indicated.",36fa0ccd-33aa-4a22-8441-5f55f8d0870c,42232-9,PRECAUTIONS SECTION
28303082,"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. The mechanism of action of methocarbamol in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber.. Pharmacokinetics. In healthy volunteers, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg, the mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between and hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%.Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation. Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely. Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine.. Special populations. ElderlyThe mean (+- SD) elimination half-life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers (mean (+- SD) age, 69 (+- 4) years) was slightly prolonged compared to younger (mean (+- SD) age, 53.3 (+- 8.8) years), healthy population (1.5 (+- 0.4) hours versus 1.1 (+-0.27) hours, respectively). The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers (41 to 43% versus 46 to 50%, respectively).. Renally impaired. The clearance of methocarbamol in renally-impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40% compared to 17 normal subjects, although the mean (+- SD) elimination half-life in these two groups was similar: 1.2 (+- 0.6) versus 1.1 (+-0.3) hours, respectively.. Hepatically impaired. In patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse, the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70% compared to that obtained in age- and weight-matched normal subjects. The mean (+- SD) elimination half-life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3.38 (+- 1.62) hours and 1.11 (+- 0.27) hours, respectively.

28149723,"12.3 Pharmacokinetics. Clopidogrel is prodrug and is metabolized to pharmacologically active metabolite and inactive metabolites. Absorption After single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day, clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed. Absorption is at least 50%, based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel metabolites.Effect of FoodClopidogrel can be administered with or without food. In study in healthy male subjects when clopidogrel 75 mg per day was given with standard breakfast, mean inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was reduced by less than 9%. The active metabolite AUC0-24 was unchanged in the presence of food, while there was 57% decrease in active metabolite Cmax. Similar results were observed when clopidogrel 300 mg loading dose was administered with high-fat breakfast. MetabolismClopidogrel is extensively metabolized by two main metabolic pathways: one mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into an inactive carboxylic acid derivative (85% of circulating metabolites) and one mediated by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes. Cytochromes first oxidize clopidogrel to 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. Subsequent metabolism of the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite results in formation of the active metabolite, thiol derivative of clopidogrel. This metabolic pathway is mediated by CYP2C19, CYP3A, CYP2B6 and CYP1A2. The active thiol metabolite binds rapidly and irreversibly to platelet receptors, thus inhibiting platelet aggregation for the lifespan of the platelet.The Cmax of the active metabolite is twice as high following single 300 mg clopidogrel loading dose as it is after four days of 75 mg maintenance dose. Cmax occurs approximately 30 to 60 minutes after dosing. In the 75 to 300 mg dose range, the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite deviates from dose proportionality: increasing the dose by factor of four results in 2.0- and 2.7-fold increases in Cmax and AUC, respectively.EliminationFollowing an oral dose of 14C-labeled clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% of total radioactivity was excreted in urine and approximately 46% in feces over the days post-dosing. After single, oral dose of 75 mg, clopidogrel has half-life of approximately hours. The half-life of the active metabolite is about 30 minutes. Drug InteractionsClopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of certain inhibitors of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and reduction in platelet inhibition. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) The effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) on the systemic exposure to the clopidogrel active metabolite following multiple doses of clopidogrel 75 mg evaluated in dedicated drug interaction studies is presented in Figure 1.Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters measured in these studies showed that the interaction was highest with omeprazole and least with dexlansoprazole.. figure-01.",d14849e1-58f8-44de-9a9d-a1bb23d1f294,43682-4,PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION

28584665,"12.1 Mechanism of Action. The pharmacological activity of oxcarbazepine is primarily exerted through the 10-monohydroxy metabolite (MHD) of oxcarbazepine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The precise mechanism by which oxcarbazepine and MHD exert their anti-seizure effect is unknown; however, in vitro electrophysiological studies indicate that they produce blockade of voltage-sensitive sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcited neural membranes, inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing, and diminution of propagation of synaptic impulses. These actions are thought to be important in the prevention of seizure spread in the intact brain. In addition, increased potassium conductance and modulation of high-voltage activated calcium channels may contribute to the anticonvulsant effects of the drug. No significant interactions of oxcarbazepine or MHD with brain neurotransmitter or modulator receptor sites have been demonstrated.",a90cd1f1-5258-4b0e-92fd-c4cebe47772b,43679-0,MECHANISM OF ACTION SECTION

When using fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination, also refer to the Patient Counseling Information section of the package insert for Symbyax.General Information Healthcare providers should instruct their patients to read the Medication Guide before starting therapy with fluoxetine and to reread it each time the prescription is renewed.Healthcare providers should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with fluoxetine and should counsel them in its appropriate use. Healthcare providers should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their healthcare provider if these occur while taking fluoxetine. When using fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination, also refer to the Medication Guide for Symbyax.Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young AdultsPatients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patients prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Box Warning and Warnings nd Precautions (5.1)]. Serotonin Syndrome Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of fluoxetine and other serotonergic agents including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. Johns Wort [see Contraindications (4.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Drug Interactions (7.3)] Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome that may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular changes (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be cautioned to seek medical care immediately if they experience these symptoms.Allergic Reactions and RashPatients should be advised to notify their healthcare provider if they develop rash or hives [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Patients should also be advised of the signs and symptoms associated with severe allergic reaction, including swelling of the face, eyes, or mouth, or have trouble breathing. Patients should be cautioned to seek medical care immediately if they experience these symptoms. Abnormal Bleeding Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of fluoxetine and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents have been associated with an increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Patients should be advised to call their healthcare provider if they experience any increased or unusual bruising or bleeding while taking fluoxetine. Angle-Closure Glaucoma Patients should be advised that taking fluoxetine can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle-closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle glaucoma is not risk factor for angle-closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle closure, and have prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Hyponatremia Patients should be advised that hyponatremia has been reported as result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. More severe and/or acute cases have been associated with hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. QT ProlongationPatients should be advised that QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia including Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients treated with fluoxetine. Signs and symptoms of ventricular arrhythmia include fast, slow, or irregular heart rate, dyspnea, syncope, or dizziness, which may indicate serious cardiac arrhythmia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] Potential for Cognitive and Motor ImpairmentFluoxetine may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Patients should be advised to avoid driving car or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that their performance is not affected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. Use of Concomitant Medications Patients should be advised to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription medication, including Symbyax, Sarafem, or over-the-counter drugs, including herbal supplements or alcohol. Patients should also be advised to inform their healthcare providers if they plan to discontinue any medications they are taking while on fluoxetine.Discontinuation of Treatment Patients should be advised to take fluoxetine exactly as prescribed, and to continue taking fluoxetine as prescribed even after their symptoms improve. Patients should be advised that they should not alter their dosing regimen, or stop taking fluoxetine without consulting their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)] Patients should be advised to consult with their healthcare provider if their symptoms do not improve with fluoxetine. Sexual Dysfunction Advise patients that use of fluoxetine may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17)]. Use in Specific Populations Pregnancy -- Advise pregnant women to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with fluoxetine. Advise patients that fluoxetine use later in pregnancy may lead to increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] Advise women that there is pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to fluoxetine during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] Lactation --Advise breastfeeding women using fluoxetine to monitor infants for agitation, irritability, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)] Pediatric Use of Fluoxetine -- Fluoxetine is approved for use in pediatric patients with MDD and OCD [see Box Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Limited evidence is available concerning the longer-term effects of fluoxetine on the development and maturation of children and adolescent patients. Height and weight should be monitored periodically in pediatric patients receiving fluoxetine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] Pediatric Use of fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination Safety and efficacy of fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination in patients 10 to 17 years of age have been established for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with Bipolar Disorder [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

28376022,"12.3 Pharmacokinetics. Levocetirizine exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range in adult healthy subjects.AbsorptionLevocetirizine is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration. In adults, peak plasma concentrations are achieved 0.9 hour after administration of the oral tablet. The accumulation ratio following daily oral administration is 1.12 with steady state achieved after days. Peak concentrations are typically 270 ng/mL and 308 ng/mL following single and repeated mg once daily dose, respectively. Food had no effect on the extent of exposure (AUC) of the levocetirizine tablet, but max was delayed by about 1.25 hours and max was decreased by about 36% after administration with high fat meal; therefore, levocetirizine can be administered with or without food. dose of mg (10 mL) of levocetirizine dihydrochloride oral solution is bioequivalent to 5 mg dose of levocetirizine dihydrochloride tablets. Following oral administration of 5 mg dose of levocetirizine dihydrochloride oral solution to healthy adult subjects, the mean peak plasma concentrations were achieved approximately 0.5 hour post dose.DistributionThe mean plasma protein binding of levocetirizine in vitro ranged from 91 to 92%, independent of concentration in the range of 90 to 5000 ng/mL, which includes the therapeutic plasma levels observed. Following oral dosing, the average apparent volume of distribution is approximately 0.4 L/kg, representative of distribution in total body water. MetabolismThe extent of metabolism of levocetirizine in humans is less than 14% of the dose and therefore differences resulting from genetic polymorphism or concomitant intake of hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme inhibitors are expected to be negligible. Metabolic pathways include aromatic oxidation, N- and O-dealkylation, and taurine conjugation. Dealkylation pathways are primarily mediated by CYP3A4 while aromatic oxidation involves multiple and/or unidentified CYP isoforms.EliminationThe plasma half-life in adult healthy subjects was about to hours after administration of oral tablets and oral solution, and the mean oral total body clearance for levocetirizine was approximately 0.63 mL/kg/min. The major route of excretion of levocetirizine and its metabolites is via urine, accounting for mean of 85.4% of the dose. Excretion via feces accounts for only 12.9% of the dose. Levocetirizine is excreted both by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Renal clearance of levocetirizine correlates with that of creatinine clearance. In patients with renal impairment the clearance of levocetirizine is reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Drug Interaction StudiesIn vitro data on metabolite interaction indicate that levocetirizine is unlikely to produce, or be subject to metabolic interactions. Levocetirizine at concentrations well above Cmax level achieved within the therapeutic dose ranges is not an inhibitor of CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2A1, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4, and is not an inducer of UGT1A or CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2C9 and 3A4. No formal in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed with levocetirizine. Studies have been performed with the racemic cetirizine [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Pediatric patientsData from pediatric pharmacokinetic study with oral administration of single dose of mg levocetirizine in 14 children age to 11 years with body weight ranging between 20 and 40 kg show that max and AUC values are about 2-fold greater than that reported in healthy adult subjects in cross-study comparison. The mean max was 450 ng/mL, occurring at mean time of 1.2 hours, weight-normalized, total body clearance was 30% greater, and the elimination half-life 24% shorter in this pediatric population than in adults. Dedicated pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in pediatric patients younger than years of age. retrospective population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted in 323 subjects (181 children to years of age, 18 children to 11 years of age, and 124 adults 18 to 55 years of age) who received single or multiple doses of levocetirizine ranging from 1.25 mg to 30 mg. Data generated from this analysis indicated that administration of 1.25 mg once daily to children months to years of age results in plasma concentrations similar to those of adults receiving mg once daily.Geriatric patientsLimited pharmacokinetic data are available in elderly subjects. Following once daily repeat oral administration of 30 mg levocetirizine for days in elderly subjects (65-74 years of age), the total body clearance was approximately 33% lower compared to that in younger adults. The disposition of racemic cetirizine has been shown to be dependent on renal function rather than on age. This finding would also be applicable for levocetirizine, as levocetirizine and cetirizine are both predominantly excreted in urine. Therefore, the levocetirizine dihydrochloride dose should be adjusted in accordance with renal function in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. GenderPharmacokinetic results for 77 patients (40 men, 37 women) were evaluated for potential effect of gender. The half-life was slightly shorter in women (7.08 +- 1.72 hr) than in men (8.62 +- 1.84 hr); however, the body weight-adjusted oral clearance in women (0.67 +- 0.16 mL/min/kg) appears to be comparable to that in men (0.59 +- 0.12 mL/min/kg). The same daily doses and dosing intervals are applicable for men and women with normal renal function.RaceThe effect of race on levocetirizine has not been studied. As levocetirizine is primarily renally excreted, and there are no important racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic characteristics of levocetirizine are not expected to be different across races. No race-related differences in the kinetics of racemic cetirizine have been observed.Renal impairmentLevocetirizine exposure (AUC exhibited 1.8-, 3.2-, 4.3-, and 5.7-fold increase in mild, moderate, severe, renal impaired, and end-stage renal disease patients, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. The corresponding increases of half-life estimates were 1.4-, 2.0-, 2.9-, and 4-fold, respectively. The total body clearance of levocetirizine after oral dosing was correlated to the creatinine clearance and was progressively reduced based on severity of renal impairment. Therefore, it is recommended to adjust the dose and dosing intervals of levocetirizine based on creatinine clearance in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. In end-stage renal disease patients (CL CR 10 mL/min) levocetirizine is contraindicated. The amount of levocetirizine removed during standard 4-hour hemodialysis procedure was <10%. The dosage of levocetirizine dihydrochloride should be reduced in patients with mild renal impairment. Both the dosage and frequency of administration should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Hepatic impairmentLevocetirizine dihydrochloride has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. The non-renal clearance (indicative of hepatic contribution) was found to constitute about 28% of the total body clearance in healthy adult subjects after oral administration.As levocetirizine is mainly excreted unchanged by the kidney, it is unlikely that the clearance of levocetirizine is significantly decreased in patients with solely hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2)].",97a67686-7e94-dd77-e053-2995a90a42c6,43682-4,PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION

Spironolactone tablets are an aldosterone antagonist indicated for:The treatment of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and to reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure 1.1). Use as an add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions 1.2). The management of edema in adult patients who are cirrhotic when edema is not responsive to fluid and sodium restrictions and in the setting of nephrotic syndrome when treatment of the underlying disease, restriction of fluid and sodium intake, and the use of other diuretics produce an inadequate response 1.3). Treatment of primary hyperaldosternism for: 1.4) Short-term preoperative treatmentLong-term maintenance for patients with discrete aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas who are not candidates for surgery and patients with bilateral micro or macronodular adrenal hyperplasia. The treatment of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and to reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure 1.1). Use as an add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions 1.2). The management of edema in adult patients who are cirrhotic when edema is not responsive to fluid and sodium restrictions and in the setting of nephrotic syndrome when treatment of the underlying disease, restriction of fluid and sodium intake, and the use of other diuretics produce an inadequate response 1.3). Treatment of primary hyperaldosternism for: 1.4) Short-term preoperative treatment. Long-term maintenance for patients with discrete aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas who are not candidates for surgery and patients with bilateral micro or macronodular adrenal hyperplasia. 1.1 Heart Failure. Spironolactone tablets are indicated for treatment of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure. Spironolactone tablets are usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies.. 1.2 Hypertension. Spironolactone tablets are indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in patients who are not adequately controlled on other agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from wide variety of pharmacologic classes. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Programs Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.. 1.3 Edema Associated with HepaticCirrhosis or Nephrotic Syndrome. Spironolactone tablets are indicated for the management of edema in the following settings:Cirrhosis of the liver when edema is not responsive to fluid and sodium restriction. Nephrotic syndrome when treatment of the underlying disease, restriction of fluid and sodium intake, and the use of other diuretics produce an inadequate response.Because it increases serum potassium, spironolactone tablets may be useful for treating edema when administration of other diuretics has caused hypokalemia.. Cirrhosis of the liver when edema is not responsive to fluid and sodium restriction. Nephrotic syndrome when treatment of the underlying disease, restriction of fluid and sodium intake, and the use of other diuretics produce an inadequate response.. 1.4 Primary Hyperaldosteronism. Spironolactone tablets are indicated in the following settings:Short-term preoperative treatment of patients with primary hyperaldosteronism.Long-term maintenance therapy for patients with discrete aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas who are not candidates for surgery.Long-term maintenance therapy for patients with bilateral micro or macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism)..

To rule out the presence of frank neoplasm, biopsy may be considered for those areas failing to respond to treatment or recurring after treatment.. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility:. Adequate long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted with fluorouracil. Studies with the active ingredient of Carac, fluorouracil, have shown positive effects in in vitro and in vivo tests for mutagenicity and on impairment of fertility in in vivo animal studies. Fluorouracil produced morphological transformation of cells in in vitro cell transformation assays. Morphological transformation was also produced in anin vitro assay by metabolite of fluorouracil, and the transformed cells produced malignant tumors when injected into immunosuppressed syngeneic mice. Fluorouracil has been shown to exert mutagenic activity in yeast cells, Bacillus subtilis, and Drosophila assays. In addition, fluorouracil has produced chromosome damage at concentrations of 1.0 and 2.0 mcg/mL in an in vitro hamster fibroblast assay, was positive in microwell mouse lymphoma assay, and was positive in in vivo micronucleus assays in rats and mice following intraperitoneal administration. Some patients receiving cumulative doses of 0.24 to 1.0 of fluorouracil parenterally have shown an increase in numerical and structural chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Fluorouracil has been shown to impair fertility after parenteral administration in rats. Fluorouracil administered at intraperitoneal doses of 125 and 250 mg/kg has been shown to induce chromosomal aberrations and changes in chromosome organization of spermatogonia in rats. In mice, single-dose intravenous and intraperitoneal injections of fluorouracil have been reported to kill differentiated spermatogonia and spermatocytes at dose of 500 mg/kg and produce abnormalities in spermatids at 50 mg/kg.. Pediatric Use:. Actinic keratosis is not condition seen within the pediatric population, except in association with rare genetic diseases. Carac should not be used in children. The safety and effectiveness of Carac have not been established in patients less than 18 years old.. Geriatric Use:. No significant differences in safety and efficacy measures were demonstrated in patients age 65 and older compared to all other patients.. Pregnancy:. See CONTRAINDICATIONS. Nursing Women:. It is not known whether fluorouracil is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from fluorouracil, decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",6795f2b1-1381-4a4f-ad34-2c28ebd1cfaf,42232-9,PRECAUTIONS SECTION

28433738,"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=2% and greater than placebo) are dizziness, upper respiratory infection, cough, and back pain. (6.1)To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Northstar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Losartan potassium-hydrochlorothiazide has been evaluated for safety in 858 patients treated for essential hypertension and 3889 patients treated for hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Most adverse reactions have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 2.8% and 2.3% of patients treated with the combination and placebo, respectively. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions occurring in greater than 2% of subjects treated with losartan-hydrochlorothiazide and at greater rate than placebo were: back pain (2.1% vs 0.6%), dizziness (5.7% vs 2.9%), and upper respiratory infection (6.1% vs 4.6%).The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide and/or the individual components: Blood and the lymphatic system disorders: Anemia, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Anorexia, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, electrolyte imbalance including hyponatremia and hypokalemia. Psychiatric disorders: Insomnia, restlessness. Nervous system disorders: Dysgeusia, headache, migraine, paraesthesias. Eye disorders: Xanthopsia, transient blurred vision. Cardiac disorders: Palpitation, tachycardia. Vascular disorders: Dose-related orthostatic effects, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis, cutaneous vasculitis). Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Nasal congestion. Gastrointestinal disorders: Dyspepsia, abdominal pain, gastric irritation, cramping, nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis, sialoadenitis. Hepato-biliary disorders: Jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice). Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash, pruritus, purpura, toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria, photosensitivity, cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Muscle cramps, muscle spasm. Renal and urinary disorders: Glycosuria, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis, renal failure. Reproductive system and breast disorders: Erectile dysfunction/impotence. General disorders and administration site conditions: Chest pain, malaise, weakness. Investigations: Liver function abnormalities. Cough Persistent dry cough has been associated with ACE-inhibitor use and in practice can be cause of discontinuation of ACE-inhibitor therapy. Two prospective, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials were conducted to assess the effects of losartan on the incidence of cough in hypertensive patients who had experienced cough while receiving ACE-inhibitor therapy. Patients who had typical ACE-inhibitor cough when challenged with lisinopril, whose cough disappeared on placebo, were randomized to losartan 50 mg, lisinopril 20 mg, or either placebo (one study, n=97) or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide (n=135). The double-blind treatment period lasted up to weeks. The incidence of cough is shown in Table below.Table 1: Demographics (89% Caucasian, 64% female)+ Demographics (90% Caucasian, 51% female)Study HCTZ Losartan Lisinopril Cough 25% 17% 69% Study 2+ Placebo Losartan Lisinopril Cough 35% 29% 62% These studies demonstrate that the incidence of cough associated with losartan therapy, in population that all had cough associated with ACE-inhibitor therapy, is similar to that associated with hydrochlorothiazide or placebo therapy. Cases of cough, including positive re-challenges, have been reported with the use of losartan in postmarketing experience.. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish causal relationship to drug exposure. Digestive: Hepatitis has been reported rarely in patients treated with losartan.Hematologic: Thrombocytopenia. Hypersensitivity: Angioedema, including swelling of the larynx and glottis, causing airway obstruction and/or swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue has been reported rarely in patients treated with losartan; some of these patients previously experienced angioedema with other drugs including ACE inhibitors. Vasculitis, including Henoch-Schonlein purpura, has been reported with losartan. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Musculoskeletal: Rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Erythroderma.Non-melanoma Skin Cancer: Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In study conducted in the Sentinel System, increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately additional case per 16,000 patients per year, and for white patients taking cumulative dose of >=50,000 mg the risk increase was approximately additional SCC case for every 6,700 patients per year.",cedd3d4f-5902-4159-bde3-4cf33d098999,34084-4,ADVERSE REACTIONS SECTION
28316836,"General Precautions. Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis.Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation.The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids.Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia.Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency; hypertension; osteoporosis; and myasthenia gravis.Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed.Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate significant effect. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporine. Since concurrent use of these agents results in mutual inhibition of metabolism, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur.",63106192-35d5-6989-e053-2991aa0aa714,34072-9,GENERAL PRECAUTIONS SECTION
28061652,"Pharmacodynamics. The mechanism of action of mirtazapine tablets, as with other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, is unknown.Evidence gathered in preclinical studies suggests that mirtazapine enhances central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. These studies have shown that mirtazapine acts as an antagonist at central presynaptic 2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, an action that is postulated to result in an increase in central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity.Mirtazapine is potent antagonist of 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. Mirtazapine has no significant affinity for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors.Mirtazapine is potent antagonist of histamine (H1) receptors, property that may explain its prominent sedative effects.Mirtazapine is moderate peripheral 1-adrenergic antagonist, property that may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use.Mirtazapine is moderate antagonist at muscarinic receptors, property that may explain the relatively low incidence of anticholinergic side effects associated with its use.",1d4ca80a-5360-49d0-a3aa-b551b5b0de02,43681-6,PHARMACODYNAMICS SECTION
28536676,"OVERDOSAGE Experience with nifedipine overdosage is limited. Generally, overdosage with nifedipine leading to pronounced hypotension calls for active cardiovascular support, including monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, judicious use of calcium infusion, pressor agents, and fluids. Clearance of nifedipine would be expected to be prolonged in patients with impaired liver function. Since nifedipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of any benefit.There has been one reported case of massive overdosage with nifedipine extended-release tablets. The main effects of ingestion of approximately 4800 mg of nifedipine extended-release tablets in young man attempting suicide as result of cocaine-induced depression was initial dizziness, palpitations, flushing, and nervousness. Within several hours of ingestion, nausea, vomiting, and generalized edema developed. No significant hypotension was apparent at presentation, 18 hours post-ingestion. Electrolyte abnormalities consisted of mild, transient elevation of serum creatinine, and modest elevations of LDH and CPK, but normal SGOT. Vital signs remained stable, no electrocardiographic abnormalities were noted, and renal function returned to normal within 24 to 48 hours with routine supportive measures alone. No prolonged sequelae were observed.The effect of single 900 mg ingestion of nifedipine capsules in depressed anginal patient also on tricyclic antidepressants was loss of consciousness within 30 minutes of ingestion, and profound hypotension, which responded to calcium infusion, pressor agents, and fluid replacement. variety of ECG abnormalities were seen in this patient with history of bundle branch block, including sinus bradycardia and varying degrees of AV block. These dictated the prophylactic placement of temporary ventricular pacemaker, but otherwise resolved spontaneously. Significant hyperglycemia was seen initially in this patient, but plasma glucose levels rapidly normalized without further treatment.A young hypertensive patient with advanced renal failure ingested 280 mg of nifedipine capsules at one time, with resulting marked hypotension responding to calcium infusion and fluids. No AV conduction abnormalities, arrhythmias, or pronounced changes in heart rate were noted, nor was there any further deterioration in renal function.",a84be46e-bb0c-d59f-e053-2a95a90aabde,34088-5,OVERDOSAGE SECTION

28750686,"14 CLINICAL STUDIES. Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%) with mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with predominance of urge) as evidenced by >= urge incontinence episodes per week and >= 10 micturitions per day. Study was fixed-dose escalation design, whereas the other two studies used dose-adjustment design in which each patients final dose was adjusted to balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects. All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications, and these patients were maintained on final dose for up to weeks.The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following Tables 4, 5, and and Figures 3, 4, and 5.Table 4: Number of Urge Urinary Incontinence Episodes Per WeekStudy 1nOxybutynin chloride extended-release tabletsnPlaceboMean Baseline3415.91620.9Mean (SD) Change from Baseline+ 34-15.8 (8.9)16-7.6 (8.6)95% Confidence Interval for Difference(-13.6, -2.8) (Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets- Placebo) The difference between Oxybutynin chloride extended-release tablets and placebo was statistically significant.

Lactic AcidosisInform patients of the risks of lactic acidosis due to the metformin component, its symptoms, and conditions that predispose to its development [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Advise patients to discontinue SEGLUROMET immediately and to notify their doctor promptly if unexplained hyperventilation, malaise, myalgia, unusual somnolence, slow or irregular heartbeat, sensation of feeling cold (especially in the extremities), or other nonspecific symptoms occur. GI symptoms are common during initiation of metformin treatment and may occur during initiation of SEGLUROMET therapy; however, advise patients to consult their doctor if they develop unexplained symptoms. Although GI symptoms that occur after stabilization are unlikely to be drug related, such an occurrence of symptoms should be evaluated to determine if it may be due to metformin-induced lactic acidosis or other serious disease.. KetoacidosisInform patients that ketoacidosis is serious life-threatening condition and that cases of ketoacidosis have been reported during use of medicines containing SGLT2 inhibitors, including ertugliflozin, sometimes associated with illness or surgery among other risk factors. Instruct patients to check ketones (when possible) if symptoms consistent with ketoacidosis occur even if blood glucose is not elevated. If symptoms of ketoacidosis (including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and labored breathing) occur, instruct patients to discontinue SEGLUROMET and seek medical attention immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].. AmputationInform patients of the potential for an increased risk of amputations. Counsel patients about the importance of routine preventative foot care. Instruct patients to monitor for new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers, or infections involving the leg or foot and to seek medical advice immediately if such signs or symptoms develop [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].Volume DepletionInform patients that symptomatic hypotension may occur with SEGLUROMET and advise them to contact their doctor if they experience such symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP [see Drug Interactions 7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology 12.3)]. 5.3 Priapism. Rarely (probably less than in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer. Prostate cancer and BPH frequently co-exist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP and at regular intervals afterwards.. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome. Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP see Adverse Reactions 6.2)]. Most reports were in patients taking the alpha blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha blocker for longer period (5 weeks to months). IFIS is variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patients ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy. In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP has been rarely reported. If patient reports serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules USP.",713739bb-6d2d-4172-80b7-2e0a71161b3e,43685-7,WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION

Risk Summary Small amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. pharmacokinetic study in lactating women detected pregabalin in breast milk at average steady state concentrations approximately 76% of those in maternal plasma. The estimated average daily infant dose of pregabalin from breast milk (assuming mean milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day) was 0.31 mg/kg/day, which on mg/kg basis would be approximately 7% of the maternal dose [see Data]. The study did not evaluate the effects of pregabalin on milk production or the effects of pregabalin on the breastfed infant. Based on animal studies, there is potential risk of tumorigenicity with pregabalin exposure via breast milk to the breastfed infant [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Available clinical study data in patients greater than 12 years of age do not provide clear conclusion about the potential risk of tumorigenicity with pregabalin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin.DataA pharmacokinetic study in ten lactating women, who were at least 12 weeks postpartum, evaluated the concentrations of pregabalin in plasma and breast milk. Pregabalin 150 mg oral capsule was given every 12 hours (300 mg daily dose) for total of four doses. Pregabalin was detected in breast milk at average steady-state concentrations approximately 76% of those in maternal plasma. The estimated average daily infant dose of pregabalin from breast milk (assuming mean milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day) was 0.31 mg/kg/day, which on mg/kg basis would be approximately 7% of the maternal dose. The study did not evaluate the effects of pregabalin on milk production. Infants did not receive breast milk obtained during the dosing period, therefore, the effects of pregabalin on the breast fed infant were not evaluated.",c2453023-a5a9-49ab-afe7-862e125a239e,34079-4,LABOR & DELIVERY SECTION

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions from Treatment and Prophylaxis Trials in Adult and Adolescent Subjects (13 years of age and older) The overall safety profile of oseltamivir phosphate is based on data from 2,646 adult and adolescent subjects that received the recommended dosage of 75 mg orally twice daily for days for treatment of influenza and 1,943 adult and adolescent subjects that received the recommended dosage of 75 mg orally once daily for up to weeks for prophylaxis of influenza in clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions in the pooled treatment and pooled prophylaxis trials in adults and adolescents are displayed in Table 5. The majority of these adverse reactions were reported on single occasion, occurred on either the first or second treatment day and resolved spontaneously within to days. This summary includes otherwise healthy adults/adolescents and subjects at risk (subjects at higher risk of developing complications associated with influenza, e.g., elderly patients and patients with chronic cardiac or respiratory disease). In general, the safety profile in the subjects at risk was qualitatively similar to that in otherwise healthy adults/adolescents.

Adverse Reactions from Treatment and Prophylaxis Trials in Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age) total of 1,481 pediatric subjects (including otherwise healthy pediatric subjects aged year to 12 years and asthmatic pediatric subjects aged to 12 years) participated in clinical trials of oseltamivir phosphate capsules for the treatment of influenza. total of 859 pediatric subjects received treatment with oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension either at 2 mg per kg twice daily for days or weight-band dosing. Vomiting was the only adverse reaction reported at frequency of >1% in subjects receiving oseltamivir phosphate capsules (16%) compared to placebo (8%). Amongst the 148 pediatric subjects aged year to 12 years who received oseltamivir phosphate at doses of 30 to 60 mg once daily for 10 days in post-exposure prophylaxis study in household contacts (n 99), and in separate 6-week seasonal influenza prophylaxis safety study (n 49), vomiting was the most frequent adverse reaction (8% on oseltamivir phosphate versus 2% in the no prophylaxis group). Adverse Reactions from Treatment Trials in Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than year of age) Assessment of adverse reactions in pediatric subjects weeks to less than year of age was based on two open-label studies that included safety data on 135 influenza-infected subjects weeks to less than year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age) exposed to oseltamivir phosphate at doses ranging from to 3.5 mg per kg of the formulation for oral suspension twice daily orally for days. The safety profile of oseltamivir phosphate was similar across the age range studied, with vomiting (9%), diarrhea (7%) and diaper rash (7%) being the most frequently reported adverse reactions, and was generally comparable to that observed in older pediatric and adult subjects. Adverse Reactions from the Prophylaxis Trial in Immunocompromised Subjects In 12-week seasonal prophylaxis study in 475 immunocompromised subjects, including 18 pediatric subjects year to 12 years of age, the safety profile in the 238 subjects receiving oseltamivir phosphate capsules 75 mg once daily was consistent with that previously observed in other oseltamivir phosphate prophylaxis clinical trials see Clinical Studies 14.2)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of oseltamivir phosphate.

28894277,"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. Magnesium (Mg++) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 mEq/liter to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium.With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 mEq/liter to 7.5 mEq/liter.. Pharmacokinetics:. Absorption: Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution: Approximately 1% to 2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin.Metabolism: Magnesium is not metabolized.Excretion: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration.Special Populations: Renal Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Hepatic Insufficiency: Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions: Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes:Aminoglycosides Cyclosporine Digitalis AlcoholAmphotericin DiureticsCisplatin.",29241655-49c9-4bc4-89f2-79a0b24b562e,34090-1,CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION

28061960,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. Major Depressive Disorder: Usual Initial Dosage: Paroxetine Tablets should be administered as single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended initial dose is 20 mg/day. Patients were dosed in range of 20 mg/day to 50 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of Paroxetine Tablets in the treatment of major depressive disorder. As with all drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, the full effect may be delayed. Some patients not responding to 20-mg dose may benefit from dose increases, in 10-mg/day increments, up to maximum of 50 mg/day. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least week.. Maintenance Therapy:There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with Paroxetine Tablets should remain on it. It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depressive disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Whether the dose needed to induce remission is identical to the dose needed to maintain and/or sustain euthymia is unknown.Systematic evaluation of the efficacy of Paroxetine Tablets has shown that efficacy is maintained for periods of up to year with doses that averaged about 30 mg.. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: Usual Initial Dosage: Paroxetine Tablets should be administered as single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended dose of Paroxetine Tablets in the treatment of OCD is 40 mg daily. Patients should be started on 20 mg/day and the dose can be increased in 10-mg/day increments. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least week. Patients were dosed in range of 20 mg/day to 60 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of Paroxetine Tablets in the treatment of OCD. The maximum dosage should not exceed 60 mg/day.. Maintenance Therapy:Long-term maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated in 6-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with OCD assigned to paroxetine demonstrated lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials). OCD is chronic condition, and it is reasonable to consider continuation for responding patient. Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.. Panic Disorder: Usual Initial Dosage: Paroxetine Tablets should be administered as single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The target dose of Paroxetine Tablets in the treatment of panic disorder is 40 mg/day. Patients should be started on 10 mg/day. Dose changes should occur in 10-mg/day increments and at intervals of at least week. Patients were dosed in range of 10 mg/day to 60 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of Paroxetine Tablets. The maximum dosage should not exceed 60 mg/day.. Maintenance Therapy:Long-term maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated in 3-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with panic disorder assigned to paroxetine demonstrated lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials). Panic disorder is chronic condition, and it is reasonable to consider continuation for responding patient. Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.. Social Anxiety Disorder: Usual Initial Dosage: Paroxetine Tablets should be administered as single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended and initial dosage is 20 mg/day. In clinical trials the effectiveness of Paroxetine Tablets was demonstrated in patients dosed in range of 20 mg/day to 60 mg/day. While the safety of Paroxetine Tablets has been evaluated in patients with social anxiety disorder at doses up to 60 mg/day, available information does not suggest any additional benefit for doses above 20 mg/day (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials). Maintenance Therapy: There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with Paroxetine Tablets should remain on it. Although the efficacy of Paroxetine Tablets beyond 12 weeks of dosing has not been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials, social anxiety disorder is recognized as chronic condition, and it is reasonable to consider continuation of treatment for responding patient. Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.. Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Usual Initial Dosage: Paroxetine Tablets should be administered as single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. In clinical trials the effectiveness of Paroxetine Tablets was demonstrated in patients dosed in range of 20 mg/day to 50 mg/day. The recommended starting dosage and the established effective dosage is 20 mg/day. There is not sufficient evidence to suggest greater benefit to doses higher than 20 mg/day. Dose changes should occur in 10 mg/day increments and at intervals of at least week.. Maintenance Therapy: Systematic evaluation of continuing Paroxetine Tablets for periods of up to 24 weeks in patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder who had responded while taking Paroxetine Tablets during an 8-week acute treatment phase has demonstrated benefit of such maintenance (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials). Nevertheless, patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.. Special Populations: Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester: Neonates exposed to Paroxetine Tablets and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see WARNINGS: Usage in Pregnancy). When treating pregnant women with paroxetine during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment.. Dosage for Elderly or Debilitated Patients, and Patients With Severe Renal or Hepatic Impairment: The recommended initial dose is 10 mg/day for elderly patients, debilitated patients, and/or patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment. Increases may be made if indicated. Dosage should not exceed 40 mg/day.. Switching Patient to or From Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders:At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with Paroxetine Tablets. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping Paroxetine Tablets before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).. Use of Paroxetine Tablets With Other MAOIs Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue:Do not start Paroxetine Tablets in patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In patient who requires more urgent treatment of psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). In some cases, patient already receiving therapy with Paroxetine Tablets may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in particular patient, Paroxetine Tablets should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with Paroxetine Tablets may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (see WARNINGS). The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than mg/kg with Paroxetine Tablets is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use (see WARNINGS). Discontinuation of Treatment With Paroxetine Tablets:Symptoms associated with discontinuation of Paroxetine Tablets have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS: Discontinuation of Treatment With Paroxetine Tablets). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment, regardless of the indication for which Paroxetine Tablets are being prescribed. gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at more gradual rate.",66d9d573-5278-434f-bf6c-c5bc009d4a48,34068-7,DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION SECTION

The patients pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS).Administration for Patients with Normal Renal FunctionAdults with Serious Infections: mg/kg/day in equal doses every hours (see Table 1).Adults with Life-Threatening Infections: Up to mg/kg/day may be administered in or equal doses (see Table 1). The dosage should be reduced to mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated. To prevent increased toxicity due to excessive blood levels, dosage should not exceed mg/kg/day unless serum levels are monitored (see WARNINGS box and PRECAUTIONS).Table 1.

The usual duration of treatment is to 10 days. longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days.Dosage in Patients with Cystic FibrosisIn patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentration of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability.Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal FunctionWhenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy.Following loading dose of mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance or the serum creatinine of the patient, because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedules derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed.Reduced Dosage at 8-hour IntervalsWhen the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram.An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patients serum creatinine.Normal Dosage at Prolonged IntervalsIf the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patients condition is stable, dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table can be determined by multiplying the patients serum creatinine by 6.Dosage in Obese PatientsThe appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patients estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg.Intramuscular AdministrationTobramycin Injection, USP may be administered by withdrawing the appropriate dose directly from vial. Tobramycin Sulfate in 0.9% Sodium Chloride is not intended for intramuscular administration.Intravenous AdministrationFor intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box).Tobramycin Injection, USP should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route.Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. graphic reduced dosage nomogram.",c5a005b0-7b6f-4e30-df92-9a20b1ca66a1,34068-7,DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION SECTION
28568505,"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. They are concentrated by the liver in the bile and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations in biologically active form. Doxycycline is virtually completely absorbed after oral administration. Following 200 mg dose of doxycycline monohydrate, 24 normal adult volunteers averaged the following serum concentration values:Time (hr):0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 3.0 4.0 8.0 12.0 24.0 48.0 72.0 Conc.1.02 2.26 2.67 3.01 3.16 3.03 2.03 1.62 0.95 0.37 0.15 (mcg/mL) Average Observed ValuesMaximum Concentration 3.61 mcg/mL (+- 0.9 sd) Time of Maximum Concentration 2.60 hr (+- 1.10 sd) Elimination Rate Constant 0.049 per hr (+- 0.030 sd) Half-Life 16.33 hr (+- 4.53 sd) Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40%/72 hours in individuals with normal function (creatinine clearance about 75 mL/min). This percentage excretion may fall as low as to 5%/72 hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min). Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18 to 22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function.Hemodialysis does not alter serum half-life. Population pharmacokinetic analysis of sparse concentration-time data of doxycycline following standard of care intravenous and oral dosing in 44 pediatric patients (2 to 18 years of age) showed that allometrically -scaled clearance (CL) of doxycycline in pediatric patients >2 to <8 years of age (median [range] 3.58 [2.27 to 10.82] L/h/70 kg, =11) did not differ significantly from pediatric patients >8 to 18 years of age (3.27 [1.11 to 8.12] L/h/70 kg, N=33). For pediatric patients weighing <45 kg, body weight normalized doxycycline CL in those >2 to <8 years of age (median [range] 0.071 [0.041 to 0.202] L/kg/h, N=10) did not differ significantly from those >8 to 18 years of age (0.081 [0.035 to 0.126] L/kg/h, N=8). In pediatric patients weighing >45 kg, no clinically significant differences in body weight normalized doxycycline CL were observed between those >2 to <8 years (0.050 L/kg/h, N=1) and those >8 to 18 years of age (0.044 [0.014 to 0.121] L/kg/h, N=25). No clinically significant difference in CL between oral and IV dosing was observed in the small cohort of pediatric patients who received the oral (N=19) or IV (N=21) formulation alone.. Microbiology. Mechanism of Action. Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Doxycycline has bacteriostatic activity against broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Resistance. Cross resistance with other tetracyclines is common.. Antimicrobial Activity.

Clindamycin is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria.Clindamycin is also indicated in the treatment of serious infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. Its use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or other patients for whom, in the judgment of the physician, penicillin is inappropriate. Because of the risk of colitis, as described in the BOXED WARNING,before selecting clindamycin, the physician should consider the nature of the infection and the suitability of less toxic alternatives (e.g., erythromycin). Anaerobes:Serious respiratory tract infections such as empyema, anaerobic pneumonitis, and lung abscess; serious skin and soft tissue infections; septicemia; intra- abdominal infections such as peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess (typically resulting from anaerobic organisms resident in the normal gastrointestinal tract); infections of the female pelvis and genital tract such as endometritis, nongonococcal tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic cellulitis, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection. Streptococci:Serious respiratory tract infections; serious skin and soft tissue infections. Staphylococci:Serious respiratory tract infections; serious skin and soft tissue infections. Pneumococci:Serious respiratory tract infections. Bacteriologic studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to clindamycin.To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of clindamycin hydrochloride and other antibacterial drugs, clindamycin hydrochloride should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy.

28496505,"12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. 12.1 Mechanism of Action. Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is fixed-dose combination of antiviral drugs FTC and TDF [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics. Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: One emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablet was comparable to one FTC capsule (200 mg) plus one TDF tablet (300 mg) following single-dose administration to fasting healthy subjects (N=39). Emtricitabine: The pharmacokinetic properties of FTC are summarized in Table 8. Following oral administration of FTC, FTC is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring at to hours postdose. Less than 4% of FTC binds to human plasma proteins in vitro, and the binding is independent of concentration over the range of 0.02 to 200 mcg/mL. Following administration of radiolabelled FTC, approximately 86% is recovered in the urine and 13% is recovered as metabolites. The metabolites of FTC include 3-sulfoxide diastereomers and their glucuronic acid conjugate. Emtricitabine is eliminated by combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Following single oral dose of FTC, the plasma FTC half-life is approximately 10 hours. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: The pharmacokinetic properties of TDF are summarized in Table 8. Following oral administration of TDF, maximum tenofovir serum concentrations are achieved in 1.0 0.4 hour. Less than 0.7% of tenofovir binds to human plasma proteins in vitro, and the binding is independent of concentration over the range of 0.01 to 25 mcg/mL. Approximately 70 to 80% of the intravenous dose of tenofovir is recovered as unchanged drug in the urine. Tenofovir is eliminated by combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Following single oral dose of TDF, the terminal elimination half-life of tenofovir is approximately 17 hours.

Data presented as steady state values Effects of Food on Oral AbsorptionEmtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may be administered with or without food. Administration of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate following high fat meal (784 kcal; 49 grams of fat) or light meal (373 kcal; grams of fat) delayed the time of tenofovir Cmax by approximately 0.75 hour. The mean increases in tenofovir AUC and Cmax were approximately 35% and 15%, respectively, when administered with high fat or light meal, compared to administration in the fasted state. In previous safety and efficacy trials, TDF (tenofovir) was taken under fed conditions. FTC systemic exposures (AUC and Cmax) were unaffected when emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was administered with either high fat or light meal. Specific PopulationsRaceEmtricitabine: No pharmacokinetic differences due to race have been identified following the administration of FTC. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: There were insufficient numbers from racial and ethnic groups other than Caucasian to adequately determine potential pharmacokinetic differences among these populations following the administration of TDF. GenderEmtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: FTC and tenofovir pharmacokinetics are similar in male and female subjects. Pediatric Patients Treatment of HIV-1 Infection: The pharmacokinetic data for tenofovir and FTC following administration of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in pediatric subjects weighing 17 kg and above are not available. The dosage recommendations of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in this population are based on the dosage recommendations of FTC and TDF in this population. Refer to the EMTRIVA and VIREAD prescribing information for pharmacokinetic information on the individual products in pediatric patients.HIV-1 PrEP: The pharmacokinetic data for tenofovir and FTC following administration of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in HIV-1 uninfected adolescents weighing 35 kg and above are not available. The dosage recommendations of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for HIV-1 PrEP in this population are based on safety and adherence data from the ATN113 trial [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] and known pharmacokinetic information in HIV-infected adolescents taking TDF and FTC for treatment. Geriatric Patients Pharmacokinetics of FTC and tenofovir have not been fully evaluated in the elderly (65 years of age and older). Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of FTC and tenofovir are altered in subjects with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. In adult subjects with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min, Cmax and AUC0- of FTC and tenofovir were increased. No data are available to make dosage recommendations in pediatric patients with renal impairment. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir following 300 mg dose of TDF have been studied in non-HIV infected subjects with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. There were no substantial alterations in tenofovir pharmacokinetics in subjects with hepatic impairment compared with unimpaired subjects. The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or FTC have not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment; however, FTC is not significantly metabolized by liver enzymes, so the impact of liver impairment should be limited. Assessment of Drug Interactions The steady state pharmacokinetics of FTC and tenofovir were unaffected when FTC and TDF were administered together versus each agent dosed alone. In vitro studies and clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction trials have shown that the potential for CYP mediated interactions involving FTC and tenofovir with other medicinal products is low. TDF is substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters. When TDF is coadministered with an inhibitor of these transporters, an increase in absorption may be observed. No clinically significant drug interactions have been observed between FTC and famciclovir, indinavir, stavudine, TDF, and zidovudine (Tables and 10). Similarly, no clinically significant drug interactions have been observed between TDF and efavirenz, methadone, nelfinavir, oral contraceptives, ribavirin, or sofosbuvir in trials conducted in healthy volunteers (Tables 11 and 12).Table Drug Interactions: Changes in Pharmacokinetic Parameters for FTC in the Presence of the Coadministered Drug a.

Aptivus Prescribing Information. 12.4 Microbiology. Mechanism of Action Emtricitabine: FTC, synthetic nucleoside analog of cytidine, is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine 5-triphosphate (FTC-TP), which inhibits the activity of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) by competing with the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5-triphosphate and by being incorporated into nascent viral DNA which results in chain termination. FTC-TP is weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases , and mitochondrial DNA polymerase Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: TDF is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate diester analog of adenosine monophosphate. TDF requires initial diester hydrolysis for conversion to tenofovir and subsequent phosphorylations by cellular enzymes to form tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), which inhibits the activity of HIV-1 RT by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5-triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. TFV-DP is weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases , and mitochondrial DNA polymerase Antiviral Activity Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: No antagonism was observed in combination studies evaluating the cell culture antiviral activity of FTC and tenofovir together. Emtricitabine: The antiviral activity of FTC against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, the MAGI-CCR5 cell line, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) values for FTC were in the range of 0.0013 to 0.64 uM (0.0003 to 0.158 mcg/mL). In drug combination studies of FTC with nucleoside RT inhibitors (abacavir, lamivudine, stavudine, zidovudine), non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine), and protease inhibitors (amprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir), no antagonism was observed. Emtricitabine displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to 0.075 uM) and showed strain-specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to 1.5 uM).Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: The antiviral activity of tenofovir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, primary monocyte/macrophage cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes. The EC50 values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.04 to 8.5 uM. In drug combination studies of tenofovir with nucleoside RT inhibitors (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, zidovudine), non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine), and protease inhibitors (amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir), no antagonism was observed. Tenofovir displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and (EC50 values ranged from 0.5 to 2.2 uM) and showed strain-specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 1.6 uM to 5.5 uM).Prophylactic Activity in Nonhuman Primate Model of HIV-1 Transmission Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: The prophylactic activity of the combination of daily oral FTC and TDF was evaluated in controlled study of macaques inoculated once weekly for 14 weeks with SIV/HIV-1 chimeric virus (SHIV) applied to the rectal surface. Of the 18 control animals, 17 became infected after median of weeks. In contrast, of the animals treated daily with oral FTC and TDF remained uninfected and the two infections that did occur were significantly delayed until and 12 weeks and exhibited reduced viremia. An M184I-expressing FTC-resistant variant emerged in of the macaques after weeks of continued drug exposure.Resistance Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to the combination of FTC and tenofovir have been selected in cell culture. Genotypic analysis of these isolates identified the M184V/I and/or K65R amino acid substitutions in the viral RT. In addition, K70E substitution in the HIV-1 RT has been selected by tenofovir and results in reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. In Study 934, clinical trial of treatment-naive subjects [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], resistance analysis was performed on HIV-1 isolates from all confirmed virologic failure subjects with greater than 400 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA at Week 144 or early discontinuation. Development of efavirenz resistance-associated substitutions occurred most frequently and was similar between the treatment arms. The M184V amino acid substitution, associated with resistance to FTC and lamivudine, was observed in 2/19 analyzed subject isolates in the FTC+TDF group and in 10/29 analyzed subject isolates in the zidovudine/lamivudine group. Through 144 weeks of Study 934, no subjects have developed detectable K65R or K70E substitution in their HIV-1 as analyzed through standard genotypic analysis. Emtricitabine: FTC-resistant isolates of HIV-1 have been selected in cell culture and in vivo. Genotypic analysis of these isolates showed that the reduced susceptibility to FTC was associated with substitution in the HIV-1 RT gene at codon 184 which resulted in an amino acid substitution of methionine by valine or isoleucine (M184V/I). Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir have been selected in cell culture. These viruses expressed K65R substitution in RT and showed 2-to 4-fold reduction in susceptibility to tenofovir. In treatment-naive subjects, isolates from 8/47 (17%) analyzed subjects developed the K65R substitution in the TDF arm through 144 weeks; occurred in the first 48 weeks of treatment and at Week 96. In treatment-experienced subjects, 14/304 (5%) isolates from subjects failing TDF through Week 96 showed greater than 1.4-fold (median 2.7) reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. Genotypic analysis of the resistant isolates showed K65R amino acid substitution in the HIV-1 RT. iPrEx Trial: In the iPrEx trial, clinical trial of HIV-1 seronegative adult subjects [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], no amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to FTC or TDF were detected at the time of seroconversion among 48 subjects in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group and 83 subjects in the placebo group who became infected with HIV-1 during the trial. Ten subjects were observed to be HIV-1 infected at time of enrollment. The M184V/I substitutions associated with resistance to FTC were observed in of the 10 subjects (2 of in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group and of in the placebo group). One of the two subjects in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group harbored wild type virus at enrollment and developed the M184V substitution weeks after enrollment. The other subject had indeterminate resistance at enrollment but was found to have the M184I substitution weeks after enrollment. Partners PrEP Trial: In the Partners PrEP trial, clinical trial of HIV-1 seronegative adult subjects [see Clinical Studies (14.4)], no variants expressing amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to FTC or TDF were detected at the time of seroconversion among 12 subjects in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group, 15 subjects in the TDF group, and 51 subjects in the placebo group. Fourteen subjects were observed to be HIV-1 infected at the time of enrollment (3 in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group, in the TDF group, and in the placebo group). One of the three subjects in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group who was infected with wild type virus at enrollment selected an M184V expressing virus by Week 12. Two of the five subjects in the TDF group had tenofovir-resistant viruses at the time of seroconversion; one subject infected with wild type virus at enrollment developed K65R substitution by Week 16, while the second subject had virus expressing the combination of D67N and K70R substitutions upon seroconversion at Week 60, although baseline virus was not genotyped and it is unclear if the resistance emerged or was transmitted. Following enrollment, subjects (2 in the TDF group, in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group, and in the placebo group) had virus expressing K103N or V106A substitutions, which confer high-level resistance to NNRTIs but have not been associated with FTC or TDF and may have been present in the infecting virus. ATN113 Trial: In ATN113, clinical trial of HIV-1 seronegative adolescent subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)], no amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to FTC or TDF were detected at the time of seroconversion from any of the subjects who became infected with HIV-1 during the trial. All subjects who seroconverted were nonadherent to the recommended emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate dosage. Cross Resistance Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Cross-resistance among certain NRTIs has been recognized. The M184V/I and/or K65R substitutions selected in cell culture by the combination of FTC and tenofovir are also observed in some HIV-1 isolates from subjects failing treatment with tenofovir in combination with either FTC or lamivudine, and either abacavir or didanosine. Therefore, cross-resistance among these drugs may occur in patients whose virus harbors either or both of these amino acid substitutions. Emtricitabine: FTC-resistant isolates (M184V/I) were cross-resistant to lamivudine but retained susceptibility in cell culture to the NRTIs didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zidovudine, and to NNRTIs (delavirdine, efavirenz, and nevirapine). HIV-1 isolates containing the K65R substitution, selected in vivo by abacavir, didanosine, and tenofovir, demonstrated reduced susceptibility to inhibition by FTC. Viruses harboring substitutions conferring reduced susceptibility to stavudine and zidovudine (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219Q/E), or didanosine (L74V) remained sensitive to FTC. HIV-1 containing the K103N substitution associated with resistance to NNRTIs was susceptible to FTC. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: The K65R and K70E substitutions selected by tenofovir are also selected in some HIV-1 infected patients treated with abacavir or didanosine. HIV-1 isolates with the K65R and K70E substitutions also showed reduced susceptibility to FTC and lamivudine. Therefore, cross-resistance among these NRTIs may occur in patients whose virus harbors the K65R or K70E substitutions. HIV-1 isolates from subjects (N=20) whose HIV-1 expressed mean of zidovudine-associated RT amino acid substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N) showed 3.1-fold decrease in the susceptibility to tenofovir. Subjects whose virus expressed an L74V substitution without zidovudine resistance-associated substitutions (N=8) had reduced response to TDF. Limited data are available for patients whose virus expressed Y115F substitution (N=3), Q151M substitution (N=2), or T69 insertion (N=4), all of whom had reduced response.",d8c32565-9ff2-4bfb-a5cf-ae6e0e498ccc,34090-1,CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION

28608708,"8.5 Geriatric Use. The hepatic and renal tolerability of long-term naproxen administration was studied in two double-blind clinical trials involving 586 patients. Of the patients studied, 98 patients were age 65 and older and 10 of the 98 patients were age 75 and older. NAPROXEN was administered at doses of 375 mg twice daily or 750 mg twice daily for up to months. Transient abnormalities of laboratory tests assessing hepatic and renal function were noted in some patients, although there were no differences noted in the occurrence of abnormal values among different age groups. Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.14) ]. Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear, although it is possible that the increase in free naproxen concentration could be associated with an increase in the rate of adverse events per given dosage in some elderly patients. Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly, it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose. Experience indicates that geriatric patients may be particularly sensitive to certain adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Elderly or debilitated patients seem to tolerate peptic ulceration or bleeding less well when these events do occur. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in the geriatric population see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Naproxen is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Geriatric patients may be at greater risk for the development of form of renal toxicity precipitated by reduced prostaglandin formation during administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].",98efdeb8-ea38-456e-953f-ba589727f284,34082-8,GERIATRIC USE SECTION

AbsorptionThe pharmacokinetics of carisoprodol and its metabolite meprobamate were studied in crossover study of 24 healthy subjects (12 male and 12 female) who received single doses of 250 mg and 350 mg carisoprodol (see Table 2). The exposure of carisoprodol and meprobamate was dose proportional between the 250 mg and 350 mg doses. The Cmax of meprobamate was 2.5 +- 0.5 ug/mL (mean +- SD) after administration of single 350 mg dose of carisoprodol, which is approximately 30% of the Cmax of meprobamate (approximately ug/mL) after administration of single 400 mg dose of meprobamate.

The mean time to peak plasma concentrations (T max) of carisoprodol was approximately 1.5 to hours. Food Effect: Co-administration of high-fat meal with carisoprodol (350 mg tablet) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of carisoprodol. Therefore, carisoprodol may be administered with or without food. EliminationMetabolism: The major pathway of carisoprodol metabolism is via the liver by cytochrome enzyme CYP2C19 to form meprobamate. This enzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism (see Patients with Reduced CYP2C19 Activity below). Excretion: Carisoprodol is eliminated by both renal and non-renal routes with terminal elimination half-life of approximately hours. The half-life of meprobamate is approximately 10 hours. Specific PopulationsSex: Exposure of carisoprodol is higher in female than in male subjects (approximately 30-50% on weight adjusted basis). Overall exposure of meprobamate is comparable between female and male subjects. Patients with Reduced CYP2C19 Activity: carisoprodol should be used with caution in patients with reduced CYP2C19 activity. Published studies indicate that patients who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers have 4-fold increase in exposure to carisoprodol, and concomitant 50% reduced exposure to meprobamate compared to normal CYP2C19 metabolizers. The prevalence of poor metabolizers in Caucasians and African Americans is approximately 3-5% and in Asians is approximately 15-20%.",4626a7a7-c433-4dab-8deb-e6e45de493a6,43682-4,PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION

28248623,"WARNINGS. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs, but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Use doxycycline in pediatric patients years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening conditions (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), particularly when there are no alternative therapies.Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Doxycycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.C. difficile produces toxins and which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following the use of antibacterial drugs. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing use of antibacterial drugs not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.Severe skin reactions, such as exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS.) If severe skin reactions occur, doxycycline should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy should be instituted.Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including Doxycycline. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and Doxycycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize.All tetracyclines form stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued.Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has also been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.",056e28a2-78e6-442f-b76a-69e39a2e0f1c,34071-1,WARNINGS SECTION

28240828,"8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy RegistryThere is pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Valproic Acid, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking Valproic Acid during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling toll free 1-888-233-2334, or visiting the website,http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. This must be done by the patient herself.Risk SummaryFor use in prophylaxis of migraine headaches, valproate is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications (4)]. For use in epilepsy or bipolar disorder, valproate should not be used to treat women who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. Women with epilepsy who become pregnant while taking valproate should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat of life.Maternal valproate use during pregnancy for any indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects including spina bifida, but also malformations involving other body systems (e.g., craniofacial defects including oral clefts, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). This risk is dose-dependent; however, threshold dose below which no risk exists cannot be established. Valproate polytherapy with other AEDs has been associated with an increased frequency of congenital malformations compared with AED monotherapy. The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester; however, other serious developmental effects can occur with valproate use throughout pregnancy. The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to epileptic mothers who used valproate during pregnancy has been shown to be about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers who use other anti-seizure monotherapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Data (Human)].Epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores and higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders compared to children exposed to either another AED in utero or to no AEDs in utero [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 and Data Human)]. An observational study has suggested that exposure to valproate products during pregnancy increases the risk of autism spectrum disorders [See Data (Human)]. In animal studies, valproate administration during pregnancy resulted in fetal structural malformations similar to those seen in humans and neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring at clinically relevant doses [see Data (Animal)].There have been reports of hypoglycemia in neonates and fatal cases of hepatic failure in infants following maternal use of valproate during pregnancy.Pregnant women taking valproate may develop hepatic failure or clotting abnormalities including thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia and/or decrease in other coagulation factors which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate including death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.8)]. Available prenatal diagnostic testing to detect neural tube and other defects should be offered to pregnant women using valproate.Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population. It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation. Dietary folic acid supplementation both prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients using valproate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. All pregnancies have background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S.general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal riskTo prevent major seizures, women with epilepsy should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life. Even minor seizures may pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. However, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy in individual cases if the seizure disorder severity and frequency do not pose serious threat to the patient.Maternal adverse reactionsPregnant women taking valproate may develop clotting abnormalities including thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and/or decrease in other coagulation factors, which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate including death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. If valproate is used in pregnancy, the clotting parameters should be monitored carefully in the mother. If abnormal in the mother, then these parameters should also be monitored in the neonate.Patients taking valproate may develop hepatic failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Fatal cases of hepatic failure in infants exposed to valproate in utero have also been reported following maternal use of valproate during pregnancy. Hypoglycemia has been reported in neonates whose mothers have taken valproate during pregnancy.DataHumanNeural tube defects and other structural abnormalitiesThere is an extensive body of evidence demonstrating that exposure to valproate in utero increases the risk of neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities. Based on published data from the CDCs National Birth Defects Prevention Network, the risk of spina bifida in the general population is about 0.06 to 0.07% (6 to in 10,000 births) compared to the risk following in utero valproate exposure estimated to be approximately to 2% (100 to 200 in 10,000 births).The NAAED Pregnancy Registry has reported major malformation rate of 9-11% in the offspring of women exposed to an average of 1,000 mg/day of valproate monotherapy during pregnancy. These data show up to five-fold increased risk for any major malformation following valproate exposure in utero compared to the risk following exposure in utero to other AEDs taken as monotherapy. The major congenital malformations included cases of neural tube defects, cardiovascular malformations,craniofacial defects (e.g., oral clefts, craniosynostosis), hypospadias, limb malformations (e.g., clubfoot,polydactyly), and malformations of varying severity involving other body systems[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Effect on IQ and neurodevelopmental effects Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores than children exposed to either another AED in utero or to no AEDs in utero. The largest of these studies1 is prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n=62) had lower IQ scores at age (97 [95% C.I. 94-101]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other anti-epileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine (108 [95% C.I. 105-110]), carbamazepine (105 [95% C.I. 102-108]) and phenytoin(108 [95% C.I. 104-112]). It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproate-exposed children occur. Because the women in this study were exposed to AEDs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].Although all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports causal association between valproate exposure in utero and subsequent adverse effects on neurodevelopment, including increases in autism spectrum disorders. An observational study has suggested that exposure to valproate products during pregnancy increases the risk of autism spectrum disorders. In this study, children born to mothers who had used valproate products during pregnancy had 2.9 times the risk (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-4.9) of developing autism spectrum disorders compared to children born to mothers not exposed to valproate products during pregnancy. The absolute risks for autism spectrum disorders were 4.4% (95% CI: 2.6%-7.5%) in valproate-exposed children and 1.5% (95% CI: 1.5%-1.6%) in children not exposed to valproate products. Because the study was observational in nature, conclusions regarding causal association between in utero valproate exposure and an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder cannot be considered definitiveOtherThere are published case reports of fatal hepatic failure in offspring of women who used valproate during pregnancy.AnimalIn developmental toxicity studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys, increased rates of fetal structural abnormalities, intrauterine growth retardation, and embryo-fetal death occurred following administration of valproate to pregnant animals during organogenesis at clinically relevant doses(calculated on body surface area [mg/m2] basis). Valproate induced malformations of multiple organ systems, including skeletal, cardiac, and urogenital defects. In mice, in addition to other malformations, fetal neural tube defects have been reported following valproate administration during critical periods of organogenesis, and the teratogenic response correlated with peak maternal drug levels. Behavioral abnormalities (including cognitive, locomotor, and social interaction deficits) and brain histopathological changes have also been reported in mice and rat offspring exposed prenatally to clinically relevant doses of valproate.",86dd50d5-4890-4b3c-8681-18796eff97b6,42228-7,PREGNANCY SECTION

27960301,"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. Mechanism of Action: Ropinirole hydrochloride is non-ergoline dopamine agonist with high relative in vitro specificity and full intrinsic activity at the D2 and D3 dopamine receptor subtypes, binding with higher affinity to D3 than to D2 or D4 receptor subtypes. Ropinirole has moderate in vitro affinity for opioid receptors. Ropinirole and its metabolites have negligible in vitro affinity for dopamine D1, 5-HT1, 5-HT2, benzodiazepine, GABA, muscarinic, alpha1-, alpha2-, and beta-adrenoreceptors.. Parkinsons Disease:. The precise mechanism of action of ropinirole hydrochloride as treatment for Parkinsons disease is unknown, although it is believed to be due to stimulation of postsynaptic dopamine D2-type receptors within the caudate-putamen in the brain. This conclusion is supported by studies that show that ropinirole improves motor function in various animal models of Parkinsons disease. In particular, ropinirole attenuates the motor deficits induced by lesioning the ascending nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in primates. The relevance of D3 receptor binding in Parkinsons disease is unknown. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS):. The precise mechanism of action of ropinirole hydrochloride as treatment for Restless Legs Syndrome (also known as Ekbom Syndrome) is unknown. Although the pathophysiology of RLS is largely unknown, neuropharmacological evidence suggests primary dopaminergic system involvement. Positron emission tomographic (PET) studies suggest that mild striatal presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of RLS. Clinical Pharmacology Studies: In healthy normotensive subjects, single oral doses of ropinirole hydrochloride in the range 0.01 to 2.5 mg had little or no effect on supine blood pressure and pulse rates. Upon standing, ropinirole hydrochloride caused decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at doses above 0.25 mg. In some subjects, these changes were associated with the emergence of orthostatic symptoms, bradycardia, and, in one case, transient sinus arrest with syncope. With repeat dosing and slow titration up to mg once daily in healthy volunteers, postural hypotension or hypotension-related adverse events were noted in 13% of subjects on ropinirole hydrochloride and none of the subjects on placebo.The mechanism of postural hypotension induced by ropinirole hydrochloride is presumed to be due to D2-mediated blunting of the noradrenergic response to standing and subsequent decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. Nausea is common concomitant symptom of orthostatic signs and symptoms. At oral doses as low as 0.2 mg, ropinirole hydrochloride suppressed serum prolactin concentrations in healthy male volunteers. Ropinirole hydrochloride had no dose-related effect on ECG wave form and rhythm in young, healthy, male volunteers in the range of 0.01 to 2.5 mg. Ropinirole hydrochloride had no dose-or exposure-related effect on mean QT intervals in healthy male and female volunteers titrated to doses up to mg/day. The effect of ropinirole hydrochloride on QT intervals at higher exposures achieved either due to drug interactions or at doses used in Parkinsons disease has not been systematically evaluated. Pharmacokinetics:. Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Elimination: The pharmacokinetics of ropinirole are similar in Parkinsons disease patients and patients with Restless Legs Syndrome. Ropinirole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak concentration in approximately 1-2 hours. In clinical studies, over 88% of radiolabeled dose was recovered in urine and the absolute bioavailability was 55%, indicating first-pass effect. Relative bioavailability from tablet compared to an oral solution is 85%. Food does not affect the extent of absorption of ropinirole, although its Tmax is increased by 2.5 hours and its Cmax is decreased by approximately 25% when the drug is taken with high-fat meal. The clearance of ropinirole after oral administration to patients is 47 L/hr (cv 45%) and its elimination half-life is approximately hours. Ropinirole is extensively metabolized by the liver to inactive metabolites and displays linear kinetics over the therapeutic dosing range of to mg times daily. Steady-state concentrations are expected to be achieved within days of dosing. Accumulation upon multiple dosing is predictive from single dosing. Ropinirole is widely distributed throughout the body, with an apparent volume of distribution of 7.5 L/kg (cv 32%). It is up to 40% bound to plasma proteins and has blood-to-plasma ratio of 1:1. The major metabolic pathways are N-despropylation and hydroxylation to form the inactive N-despropyl and hydroxy metabolites. In vitro studies indicate that the major cytochrome P450 isozyme involved in the metabolism of ropinirole is CYP1A2, an enzyme known to be stimulated by smoking and omeprazole, and inhibited by, for example, fluvoxamine, mexiletine, and the older fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. The N-despropyl metabolite is converted to carbamyl glucuronide, carboxylic acid, and N-despropyl hydroxy metabolites. The hydroxy metabolite of ropinirole is rapidly glucuronidated. Less than 10% of the administered dose is excreted as unchanged drug in urine. N-despropyl ropinirole is the predominant metabolite found in urine (40%), followed by the carboxylic acid metabolite (10%), and the glucuronide of the hydroxy metabolite (10%).. P450 Interaction: In vitro metabolism studies showed that CYP1A2 was the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of ropinirole. Inhibitors or inducers of this enzyme have been shown to alter its clearance when coadministered with ropinirole. Therefore, if therapy with drug known to be potent inhibitor of CYP1A2 is stopped or started during treatment with ropinirole hydrochloride, adjustment of the dose of ropinirole hydrochloride may be required. Population Subgroups: Because therapy with ropinirole hydrochloride is initiated at low dose and gradually titrated upward according to clinical tolerability to obtain the optimum therapeutic effect, adjustment of the initial dose based on gender, weight, or age is not necessary. Age: Oral clearance of ropinirole is reduced by 30% in patients above 65 years of age compared to younger patients. Dosage adjustment is not necessary in the elderly (above 65 years), as the dose of ropinirole is to be individually titrated to clinical response.. Gender:. Female and male patients showed similar oral clearance.. Race:. The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of ropinirole has not been evaluated. Cigarette Smoking: Smoking is expected to increase the clearance of ropinirole since CYP1A2 is known to be induced by smoking. In study in patients with RLS, smokers (n 7) had an approximate 30% lower Cmax and 38% lower AUC than did nonsmokers (n 11), when those parameters were normalized for dose. Renal Impairment: Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, no difference was observed in the pharmacokinetics of ropinirole in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance between 30 to 50 mL/min.) compared to an age-matched population with creatinine clearance above 50 mL/min. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary in moderately renally impaired patients. The use of ropinirole hydrochloride in patients with severe renal impairment has not been studied. The effect of hemodialysis on drug removal is not known, but because of the relatively high apparent volume of distribution of ropinirole (525 L), the removal of the drug by hemodialysis is unlikely.. Hepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of ropinirole have not been studied in hepatically impaired patients. These patients may have higher plasma levels and lower clearance of the drug than patients with normal hepatic function. The drug should be titrated with caution in this population.. Other Diseases: Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no change in the oral clearance of ropinirole in patients with concomitant diseases such as hypertension, depression, osteoporosis/arthritis, and insomnia compared to patients with Parkinsons disease only. Clinical Trials:. Parkinsons Disease: The effectiveness of ropinirole hydrochloride in the treatment of Parkinsons disease was evaluated in multinational drug development program consisting of 11 randomized, controlled trials. Four were conducted in patients with early Parkinsons disease and no concomitant levodopa (L-dopa), and were conducted in patients with advanced Parkinsons disease with concomitant L-dopa. Among these 11 studies, placebo-controlled studies provide the most persuasive evidence of ropiniroles effectiveness in the management of patients with Parkinsons disease who were and were not receiving concomitant L-dopa. Two of these trials enrolled patients with early Parkinsons disease (without L-dopa) and enrolled patients receiving L-dopa. In these studies variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment (e.g., the Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS], Clinical Global Impression [CGI] scores, patient diaries recording time on and off, and tolerability of L-dopa dose reductions). In both studies of early Parkinsons disease (without L-dopa) patients, the motor component (Part III) of the UPDRS was the primary outcome assessment. The UPDRS is 4-part multi-text rating scale intended to evaluate mentation (Part I), activities of daily living (Part II), motor performance (Part III), and complications of therapy (Part IV). Part III of the UPDRS contains 14 texts designed to assess the severity of the cardinal motor findings in patients with Parkinsons disease (e.g., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, etc.) scored for different body regions and has maximum (worst) score of 108. Responders were defined as patients with at least 30% reduction in the Part III score. In the study of advanced Parkinsons disease (with L-dopa) patients, both reduction in percent awake time spent off and the ability to reduce the daily use of L-dopa were assessed as combined endpoint and individually. Studies in Patients With Early Parkinsons Disease (Without L-dopa): One early therapy study was 12-week multicenter study in which 63 patients (41 on ropinirole hydrochloride) with idiopathic Parkinsons disease receiving concomitant anti-Parkinson medication (but not L-dopa) were randomized to either ropinirole hydrochloride or placebo. Patients had mean disease duration of approximately years. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they presented with bradykinesia and at least tremor, rigidity, or postural instability. In addition, they must have been classified as Hoehn Yahr Stage I-IV. This scale, ranging from = unilateral involvement with minimal impairment to = confined to wheelchair or bed, is standard instrument used for staging patients with Parkinsons disease. The primary outcome measure in this trial was the proportion of patients experiencing decrease (compared to baseline) of at least 30% in the UPDRS motor score. Patients were titrated for up to 10 weeks, starting at 0.5 mg twice daily, with weekly increments of 0.5 mg twice daily to maximum of mg twice daily. Once patients reached their maximally tolerated dose (or mg twice daily), they were maintained on that dose through 12 weeks. The mean dose achieved by patients at study endpoint was 7.4 mg/day. At the end of 12 weeks, 71% of patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride were responders, compared with 41% of patients in the placebo group (p 0.021). Statistically significant differences between the percentage of responders on ropinirole hydrochloride compared to placebo were seen after weeks of treatment. In addition, the mean percentage improvement from baseline in the Total Motor Score was 43% in patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride compared with 21% in patients treated with placebo (p 0.018). Statistically significant differences in UPDRS motor score between ropinirole hydrochloride and placebo were seen after weeks of treatment. The median daily dose at which 30% reduction in UPDRS motor score was sustained was mg. The second trial in early Parkinsons disease (without L-dopa) patients was double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month study. Patients were essentially similar to those in the study described above; concomitant use of selegiline was allowed, but patients were not permitted to use anticholinergics or amantadine during the study. Patients had mean disease duration of years and limited (not more than 6-week period) or no prior exposure to L-dopa. The starting dose of ropinirole hydrochloride in this trial was 0.25 mg times daily. The dose was titrated at weekly intervals by increments of 0.25 mg times daily to dose of mg times daily. Further titrations at weekly intervals were at increments of 0.5 mg times daily up to dose of mg times daily, and then weekly at increments of mg times daily. Patients were to be titrated to dose of at least 1.5 mg times daily and then to their maximally tolerated dose, up to maximum of mg times daily. The mean dose attained in patients at study endpoint was 15.7 mg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the mean percent reduction (improvement) from baseline in the UPDRS Motor Score. In this study 241 patients were enrolled. At the end of the 6-month study, patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride had 22% improvement in motor score, compared with 4% worsening in the placebo group (p<0.001).Statistically significant differences in UPDRS motor score improvement between ropinirole hydrochloride and placebo were seen after 12 weeks of treatment. Study in Patients With Advanced Parkinsons Disease (With L-dopa):. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month trial evaluated 148 patients (Hoehn Yahr II-IV) who were not adequately controlled on L-dopa. Patients in this study had mean disease duration of approximately years, had been exposed to L-dopa for approximately years, and had experienced on-off periods with L-dopa therapy. Patients previously receiving stable doses of selegiline, amantadine, and/or anticholinergic agents could continue on these agents during the study. Patients were started at dose of 0.25 mg times daily of ropinirole hydrochloride and titrated upward by weekly intervals until an optimal therapeutic response was achieved. The maximum dose of study medication was mg times daily. All patients had to be titrated to at least dose of 2.5 mg times daily. Patients could then be maintained on this dose level or higher for the remainder of the study. Once dose of 2.5 mg times daily was achieved, patients underwent mandatory reduction in their L-dopa dose, to be followed by additional mandatory reductions with continued escalation of the dose of ropinirole hydrochloride. Reductions in the dosage of L-dopa were also allowed if patients experienced adverse events that the investigator considered related to dopaminergic therapy. The mean dose attained at study endpoint was 16.3 mg/day. The primary outcome was the proportion of responders, defined as patients who were able both to achieve decrease (compared to baseline) of at least 20% in their L-dopa dose and decrease of at least 20% in the proportion of the time awake in the off condition (a period of time during the day when patients are particularly immobile), as determined by patient diary. In addition, the mean percent change from baseline in daily L-dopa dose was examined. At the end of months, 28% of patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride were classified as responders (based on combined endpoint) while 11% of patients treated with placebo were responders (p 0.02). Based on the protocol-mandated reductions in L-dopa dosage with escalating doses of ropinirole hydrochloride, patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride had 19.4% mean reduction in L-dopa dose while patients treated with placebo had 3% reduction (p<0.001). L-dopa dosage reduction was also allowed during the study if dyskinesias or other dopaminergic effects occurred. Overall, reduction of L-dopa dose was sustained in 87% of patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride and in 57% of patients on placebo. On average, the L-dopa dose was reduced by 31% in patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride. The mean number of off hours per day during baseline was 6.4 hours for patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride and 7.3 hours for patients treated with placebo. At the end of the 6-month study, patients treated with ropinirole hydrochloride had mean of 4.9 hours per day of off time, while placebo-treated patients had mean of 6.4 hours per day of off time. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS): The effectiveness of ropinirole hydrochloride in the treatment of RLS was demonstrated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adults diagnosed with RLS using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group diagnostic criteria (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). Patients were required to have history of minimum of 15 RLS episodes/month during the previous month and total score of >=15 on the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS scale) at baseline. Patients with RLS secondary to other conditions (e.g., pregnancy, renal failure, and anemia) were excluded. All studies employed flexible dosing, with patients initiating therapy at 0.25 mg ropinirole hydrochloride once daily. Patients were titrated based on clinical response and tolerability over weeks to maximum of mg once daily. All doses were taken between and hours before bedtime. variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment, including the IRLS Scale and Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement (CGI-I) scores. The IRLS Scale contains 10 texts designed to assess the severity of sensory and motor symptoms, sleep disturbance, daytime somnolence, and impact on activities of daily living and mood associated with RLS. The range of scores is to 40, with being absence of RLS symptoms and 40 the most severe symptoms. Three of the controlled studies utilized the change from baseline in the IRLS Scale at the week 12 endpoint as the primary efficacy outcome. Three hundred eighty patients were randomized to receive ropinirole hydrochloride (n 187) or placebo (n 193) in US study; 284 were randomized to receive either ropinirole hydrochloride (n 146) or placebo (n 138) in multinational study (excluding US); and 267 patients were randomized to ropinirole hydrochloride (n 131) or placebo (n 136) in multinational study (including US). Across the studies, the mean duration of RLS was 16 to 22 years (range of to 65 years), mean age was approximately 54 years (range of 18 to 79 years), and approximately 61% were women. The mean dose at week 12 was approximately mg/day for the studies. In all studies, statistically significant difference between the treatment group receiving ropinirole hydrochloride and the treatment group receiving placebo was observed at week 12 for both the mean change from baseline in the IRLS Scale total score and the percentage of patients rated as responders (much improved or very much improved) on the CGI-I (see Table 1).

Following 24-week single-blind treatment phase (flexible doses of ropinirole hydrochloride of 0.25 to mg once daily), patients who were responders (defined as decrease of >6 points on the IRLS Scale total score relative to baseline) were randomized in double-blind fashion to placebo or continuation of ropinirole hydrochloride for an additional 12 weeks. Relapse was defined as an increase of at least points on the IRLS Scale total score to total score of at least 15, or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy. For patients who were responders at week 24, the mean dose of ropinirole was mg (range 0.25 to mg). Patients continued on ropinirole hydrochloride demonstrated significantly lower relapse rate compared with patients randomized to placebo (32.6% vs 57.8%, = 0.0156).",caa8f322-325d-4117-a564-c87391ebf6fe,34090-1,CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION

These treatment levels represented plasma drug levels of approximately 9, 13, and 26 to 35 times the mean human plasma drug concentration after 40 mg oral dose. low incidence of forestomach squamous papillomas and one carcinoma of the forestomach at the 24 mg/kg/day dose level was considered to reflect the prolonged hyperplasia induced by direct contact exposure to fluvastatin sodium rather than to systemic effect of the drug. In addition, an increased incidence of thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas was recorded for males treated with 18 to 24 mg/kg/day. The increased incidence of thyroid follicular cell neoplasm in male rats with fluvastatin sodium appears to be consistent with findings from other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. In contrast to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, no hepatic adenomas or carcinomas were observed.The carcinogenicity study conducted in mice at dose levels of 0.3, 15 and 30 mg/kg/day revealed, as in rats, statistically significant increase in forestomach squamous cell papillomas in males and females at 30 mg/kg/day and in females at 15 mg/kg/day. These treatment levels represented plasma drug levels of approximately 0.05, 2, and times the mean human plasma drug concentration after 40 mg oral dose.No evidence of mutagenicity was observed with or without rat-liver metabolic activation, in the following studies: microbial mutagen tests using mutant strains of or malignant transformation assay in BALB/3T3 cells; unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes; chromosomal aberrations in V79 Chinese Hamster cells; HGPRT V79 Chinese Hamster cells. In addition, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in either rat or mouse micronucleus test. in vitro Salmonella typhimurium Escherichia coli in vivo In study in rats at dose levels for females of 0.6, and mg/kg/day and at dose levels for males of 2, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day, fluvastatin sodium had no adverse effects on the fertility or reproductive performance.Seminal vesicles and testes were small in hamsters treated for months at 20 mg/kg/day (approximately times the 40 mg human daily dose based on surface area, mg/m ). There was tubular degeneration and aspermatogenesis in testes as well as vesiculitis of seminal vesicles. Vesiculitis of seminal vesicles and edema of the testes were also seen in rats treated for years at 18 mg/kg/day (approximately times the human achieved with 40 mg daily dose). max Fluvastatin sodium produced delays in skeletal development in rats at doses of 12 mg/kg/day and in rabbits at doses of 10 mg/kg/day. Malaligned thoracic vertebrae were seen in rats at 36 mg/kg, dose that produced maternal toxicity. These doses resulted in times (rat at 12 mg/kg) or times (rabbit at 10 mg/kg) the 40 mg human exposure based on mg/m surface area. study in which female rats were dosed during the third trimester at 12 and 24 mg/kg/day resulted in maternal mortality at or near term and postpartum. In addition, fetal and neonatal lethality were apparent. No effects on the dam or fetus occurred at mg/kg/day. second study at levels of 2, 6, 12 and 24 mg/kg/day confirmed the findings in the first study with neonatal mortality beginning at mg/kg. modified Segment III study was performed at dose levels of 12 or 24 mg/kg/day with or without the presence of concurrent supplementation with mevalonic acid, product of HMG-CoA reductase which is essential for cholesterol biosynthesis. The concurrent administration of mevalonic acid completely prevented the maternal and neonatal mortality but did not prevent low body weights in pups at 24 mg/kg on days and postpartum.",f0674ec5-22b9-4ab9-a118-54c83cda3ec2,43680-8,NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY SECTION

After controlling for level of renal function (eGFR), efficacy was similar for patients under age 65 years and those 65 years and older. In patients >=65 years of age, higher proportion of patients treated with dapagliflozin had adverse reactions of hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].In the overall population of the DAPA-HF study, 2714 (57%) out of 4744 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) were older than 65 years. Out of 2139 patients with HFrEF and type diabetes mellitus, 1211 (56.6%) were older than 65 years.

28091464,"8.1 Pregnancy. Pregnancy Registry There is pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Valproate Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking Valproate Sodium Injection during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling toll-free 1-888-233-2334 or visiting the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. This must be done by the patient herself. Risk Summary For use in prophylaxis of migraine headaches, valproate is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. For use in epilepsy or bipolar disorder, valproate should not be used to treat women who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2 5.3 )]. Women with epilepsy who become pregnant while taking valproate should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life.Maternal valproate use during pregnancy for any indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects including spina bifida, but also malformations involving other body systems (e.g., craniofacial defects including oral clefts, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). This risk is dose-dependent; however, threshold dose below which no risk exists cannot be established. Valproate polytherapy with other AEDs has been associated with an increased frequency of congenital malformations compared with AED monotherapy. The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester; however, other serious developmental effects can occur with valproate use throughout pregnancy. The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to epileptic mothers who used valproate during pregnancy has been shown to be about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers who used other anti-seizure monotherapies [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and DATA (Human)].Epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores and higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders compared to children exposed to either another AED in utero or to no AEDs in utero [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3) and DATA (Human)]. An observational study has suggested that exposure to valproate products during pregnancy increases the risk of autism spectrum disorders [see DATA (Human)]. In animal studies, valproate administration during pregnancy resulted in fetal structural malformations similar to those seen in humans and neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring at clinically relevant doses [see DATA (Animal)]. There have been reports of hypoglycemia in neonates and fatal cases of hepatic failure in infants following maternal use of valproate during pregnancy.Pregnant women taking valproate may develop hepatic failure or clotting abnormalities including thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and/or decrease in other coagulation factors, which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate including death [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1, 5.8)]. Available prenatal diagnostic testing to detect neural tube and other defects should be offered to pregnant women using valproate. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population. It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation. Dietary folic acid supplementation both prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients using valproate [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.4)].All pregnancies have background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In theU.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal riskTo prevent major seizures, women with epilepsy should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life. Even minor seizures may pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)]. However, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy in individual cases if the seizure disorder severity and frequency do not pose serious threat to the patient. Maternal adverse reactions Pregnant women taking valproate may develop clotting abnormalities including thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and/or decrease in other coagulation factors, which may result in hemorrhagic complications in the neonate including death [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)]. If valproate is used in pregnancy, the clotting parameters should be monitored carefully in the mother. If abnormal in the mother, then these parameters should also be monitored in the neonate.Patients taking valproate may develop hepatic failure [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. Fatal cases of hepatic failure in infants exposed to valproate in utero have also been reported following maternal use of valproate during pregnancy. Hypoglycemia has been reported in neonates whose mothers have taken valproate during pregnancy.Data HumanNeural tube defects and other structural abnormalitiesThere is an extensive body of evidence demonstrating that exposure to valproate in utero increases the risk of neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities. Based on published data from the CDCs National Birth Defects Prevention Network, the risk of spina bifida in the general population is about 0.06 to 0.07% (6 to in 10,000 births) compared to the risk following in utero valproate exposure estimated to be approximately to 2% (100 to 200 in 10,000 births). The NAAED Pregnancy Registry has reported major malformation rate of 9-11% in the offspring of women exposed to an average of 1,000 mg/day of valproate monotherapy during pregnancy. These data show an up to five-fold increased risk for any major malformation following valproate exposure in utero compared to the risk following exposure in utero to other AEDs taken as monotherapy. The major congenital malformations included cases of neural tube defects, cardiovascular malformations, craniofacial defects (e.g., oral clefts, craniosynostosis), hypospadias, limb malformations (e.g., clubfoot, polydactyly), and malformations of varying severity involving other body systems [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].Effect on IQ and neurodevelopmental effectsPublished epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower IQ scores than children exposed to either another AED in utero or to no AEDs in utero. The largest of these studies is prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n 62) had lower IQ scores at age (97 [95% C.I. 94-101]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other anti-epileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine (108 [95% C.I. 105-110]), carbamazepine (105 [95% C.I. 102-108]) and phenytoin (108 [95% C.I. 104-112]). It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproate-exposed children occur. Because the women in this study were exposed to AEDs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)].Although all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports causal association between valproate exposure in utero and subsequent adverse effects on neurodevelopment, including increases in autism spectrum disorders. An observational study has suggested that exposure to valproate products during pregnancy increases the risk of autism spectrum disorders. In this study, children born to mothers who had used valproate products during pregnancy had 2.9 times the risk (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-4.9) of developing autism spectrum disorders compared to children born to mothers not exposed to valproate products during pregnancy. The absolute risks for autism spectrum disorders were 4.4% (95% CI: 2.6%-7.5%) in valproate-exposed children and 1.5% (95% CI: 1.5%-1.6%) in children not exposed to valproate products. Because the study was observational in nature, conclusions regarding causal association between in utero valproate exposure and an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder cannot be considered definitive.OtherThere are published case reports of fatal hepatic failure in offspring of women who used valproate during pregnancy. Animal In developmental toxicity studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys, increased rates of fetal structural abnormalities, intrauterine growth retardation, and embryo-fetal death occurred following administration of valproate to pregnant animals during organogenesis at clinically relevant doses (calculated on body surface area [mg/m2] basis). Valproate induced malformations of multiple organ systems, including skeletal, cardiac, and urogenital defects. In mice, in addition to other malformations, fetal neural tube defects have been reported following valproate administration during critical periods of organogenesis, and the teratogenic response correlated with peak maternal drug levels. Behavioral abnormalities (including cognitive, locomotor, and social interaction deficits) and brain histopathological changes have also been reported in mice and rat offspring exposed prenatally to clinically relevant doses of valproate.",bcf57b31-4811-4104-82b3-46fb91a53ee0,42228-7,PREGNANCY SECTION

In case review study of 583 patients, 72 patients (12%) were greater than 65 years of age. higher percentage of patients above 65 years of age reported accidental injury, infection, pain, somnolence, and tremor. Discontinuation of valproate was occasionally associated with the latter two events. It is not clear whether these events indicate additional risk or whether they result from preexisting medical illness and concomitant medication use among these patients. study of elderly patients with dementia revealed drug related somnolence and discontinuation for somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] The starting dose should be reduced in these patients, and dosage reductions or discontinuation should be considered in patients with excessive somnolence [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] There is insufficient information available to discern the safety and effectiveness of valproate for the prophylaxis of migraines in patients over 65.

28873905,"12.1 Mechanism of Action. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type (PDE5) enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Tadalafil inhibits PDE5. Because sexual stimulation is required to initiate the local release of nitric oxide, the inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation. The effect of PDE5 inhibition on cGMP concentration in the corpus cavernosum and pulmonary arteries is also observed in the smooth muscle of the prostate, the bladder and their vascular supply. The mechanism for reducing BPH symptoms has not been established. Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum, prostate, and bladder as well as in vascular and visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, urethra, platelets, kidney, lung, cerebellum, heart, liver, testis, seminal vesicle, and pancreas. In vitro studies have shown that the effect of tadalafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other phosphodiesterases. These studies have shown that tadalafil is greater than 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE1, PDE2, PDE4, and PDE7 enzymes, which are found in the heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, leukocytes, skeletal muscle, and other organs. Tadalafil is greater than 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE3, an enzyme found in the heart and blood vessels. Additionally, tadalafil is 700-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE6, which is found in the retina and is responsible for phototransduction. Tadalafil is greater than 9,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE8, PDE9, and PDE10. Tadalafil is 14-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE11A1 and 40-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE11A4, two of the four known forms of PDE11. PDE11 is an enzyme found in human prostate, testes, skeletal muscle and in other tissues (e.g., adrenal cortex). In vitro, tadalafil inhibits human recombinant PDE11A1 and, to lesser degree, PDE11A4 activities at concentrations within the therapeutic range. The physiological role and clinical consequence of PDE11 inhibition in humans have not been defined.",2354c3e2-7b5f-4fdd-bbf2-7fa3c57686f8,43679-0,MECHANISM OF ACTION SECTION

27973135,"Pharmacokinetics. Absorption of isosorbide dinitrate after oral dosing is nearly complete, but bioavailability is highly variable (10% to 90%), with extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. Serum levels reach their maxima about an hour after ingestion. The average bioavailability of ISDN is about 25%; most studies have observed progressive increases in bioavailability during chronic therapy.Once absorbed, the volume of distribution of isosorbide dinitrate is to L/kg, and this volume is cleared at the rate of to L/min, so ISDNs half-life in serum is about an hour. Since the clearance exceeds hepatic blood flow, considerable extrahepatic metabolism must also occur. Clearance is affected primarily by denitration to the 2-mononitrate (15 to 25%) and the 5-mononitrate (75 to 85%).Both metabolites have biological activity, especially the 5-mononitrate. With an overall half-life of about hours, the 5-mononitrate is cleared from the serum by denitration to isosorbide, glucuronidation to the 5-mononitrate glucuronide, and denitration/hydration to sorbitol. The 2-mononitrate has been less well studied, but it appears to participate in the same metabolic pathways, with half-life of about hours.The daily dose-free interval sufficient to avoid tolerance to organic nitrates has not been well defined. Studies of nitroglycerin (an organic nitrate with very short half-life) have shown that daily dose-free intervals of 10 to 12 hours are usually sufficient to minimize tolerance. Daily dose-free intervals that have succeeded in avoiding tolerance during trials of moderate doses (e.g., 30 mg) of immediate-release ISDN have generally been somewhat longer (at least 14 hours), but this is consistent with the longer half-lives of ISDN and its active metabolites.Few well-controlled clinical trials of organic nitrates have been designed to detect rebound or withdrawal effects. In one such trial, however, subjects receiving nitroglycerin had less exercise tolerance at the end of the daily dose-free interval than the parallel group receiving placebo. The incidence, magnitude, and clinical significance of similar phenomena in patients receiving ISDN have not been studied.",9c6a10ba-04a5-4d7e-83fb-d0001d547496,43682-4,PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION

Teratogenic EffectsAmiodarone and desethylamiodarone cross the placenta.Reported risks include:o neonatal bradycardia, QT prolongation, and periodic ventricular extrasystoles neonatal hypothyroidism (with or without goiter) detected antenatally or in the newborn and reported even after few days of exposure neonatal hyperthyroxinemia neurodevelopmental abnormalities independent of thyroid function, including speech delay and difficulties with written language and arithmetic, delayed motor development, and ataxia. jerk nystagmus with synchronous head titubation fetal growth retardation premature birth Amiodarone has caused variety of adverse effects in animals.Amiodarone was given intravenously to rabbits at dosages of mg/kg per day, 10 mg/kg per day, or 25 mg/kg per day (about 0.1, 0.3, and 0.7 times the human intravenous maintenance dose of 0.5 mg/min on body surface area basis), during gestation days to 16 (organogenesis). The incidence of maternal deaths increased with increasing dose and occurred in all treated groups, and controls. Mean fetal weights were significantly decreased in the low and middle dose groups and embryotoxicity (as manifested by fewer full- term fetuses and increased resorptions) occurred at dosages of 10 mg/kg and above. There were no significant differences in the number of minor fetal abnormalities and no major fetal abnormalities were observed.Amiodarone was administered by continuous intravenous infusion to rats at dosages of 25 mg/kg per day, 50 mg/kg per day, or 100 mg/kg per day (about 0.3, 0.7, and 1.3 times the human intravenous maintenance dose of 0.5 mg/min on body surface area basis) during gestation days to 16 (organogenesis). Maternal toxicity (manifest as reduced weight gain and food consumption) and embryotoxicity (manifest as increased resorptions, decreased live litter size and fetal body weights, and delayed sternal and metacarpal ossification) were observed in the 100 mg/kg group. The delayed ossification was reversible and related to decreased fetal weight. Fetal thyroid tissues appeared normal in all groups.Nonteratogenic EffectsVery high concentrations of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone may be found in testes. Elevated follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels, suggestive of testicular dysfunction, have been reported in men on long-term amiodarone treatment.While planning pregnancy after discontinuation of amiodarone treatment, consider the long half-life of amiodarone and its metabolite DEA.8.2 Labor and DeliveryIt is not known whether the use of amiodarone during labor or delivery has any immediate or delayed adverse effects. Preclinical studies in rodents have not shown any effect on the duration of gestation or on parturition.8.3 Nursing MothersAmiodarone and one of its major metabolites, desethylamiodarone (DEA), are excreted in human milk, suggesting that breast-feeding could expose the nursing infant to significant dose of the drug. Nursing offspring of lactating rats administered amiodarone have demonstrated reduced viability and reduced body weight gains. The risk of exposing the infant to amiodarone must be weighed against the potential benefit of arrhythmia suppression in the mother. Advise the mother to discontinue nursing.8.4 Pediatric UseThe safety and effectiveness of amiodarone in pediatric patients have not been established; therefore, the use of amiodarone in pediatric patients is not recommended. In pediatric trial of 61 patients, aged 30 days to 15 years, hypotension (36%), bradycardia (20%), and AV block (15%) were common dose-related adverse reactions and were severe or life-threatening in some cases. Injection site reactions were seen in (25%) of the 20 patients receiving intravenous amiodarone through peripheral vein irrespective of dose regimen.Amiodarone hydrochloride injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol [see Description (11)]. There have been reports of fatal gasping syndrome in neonates (children less than one month of age) following the administration of intravenous solutions containing the preservative benzyl alcohol. Symptoms include striking onset of gasping respiration, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. 8.5 Geriatric UseClinical studies of amiodarone did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Carefully consider dose selection in an elderly patient. In general, start at the low end of the dosing range in the elderly to reflect the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",8d088060-70b5-e796-e053-2995a90a0969,43684-0,USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS SECTION

Risk SummaryAvailable data from published literature and postmarketing experience over several decades with azithromycin use in pregnant women have not identified any drug-associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Developmental toxicity studies with azithromycin in rats, mice, and rabbits showed no drug-induced fetal malformations at doses up to 4, 2, and times, respectively, an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area. Decreased viability and delayed development were observed in the offspring of pregnant rats administered azithromycin from day of pregnancy through weaning at dose equivalent to times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Available data from published observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades do not suggest an increased risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with azithromycin use in pregnant women. Limitations of these data include the lack of randomization and inability to control for confounders such as underlying maternal disease and maternal use of concomitant medications. Animal Data Azithromycin administered during the period of organogenesis did not cause fetal malformations in rats and mice at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (moderately maternally toxic). Based on body surface area, this dose is approximately (rats) and (mice) times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg. In rabbits administered azithromycin at oral doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg/day during organogenesis, reduced maternal body weight and food consumption were observed in all groups; no evidence of fetotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed at these doses, the highest of which is estimated to be times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area. In pre- and postnatal development study, azithromycin was administered orally to pregnant rats from day of pregnancy until weaning at doses of 50 or 200 mg/kg/day. Maternal toxicity (reduced food consumption and body weight gain; increased stress at parturition) was observed at the higher dose. Effects in the offspring were noted at 200 mg/kg/day during the postnatal development period (decreased viability, delayed developmental landmarks). These effects were not observed in pre-and postnatal rat study when up to 200 mg/kg/day of azithromycin was given orally beginning on day 15 of pregnancy until weaning. 8.2 Lactation. Risk SummaryAzithromycin is present in human milk (see Data). Non-serious adverse reactions have been reported in breastfed infants after maternal administration of azithromycin (see Clinical Considerations). There are no available data on the effects of azithromycin on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mothers clinical need for azithromycin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azithromycin or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical ConsiderationsAdvise women to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea, vomiting, or rash. DataAzithromycin breastmilk concentrations were measured in 20 women after receiving single g oral dose of azithromycin during labor. Breastmilk samples collected on days and postpartum as well as and weeks postpartum revealed the presence of azithromycin in breastmilk up to weeks after dosing. In another study, single dose of azithromycin 500 mg was administered intravenously to women prior to incision for cesarean section. Breastmilk (colostrum) samples obtained between 12 and 48 hours after dosing revealed that azithromycin persisted in breastmilk up to 48 hours. 8.4 Pediatric Use. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Indications and Usage (1.2), and Dosage and Administration (2.2)] Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with acute otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia under months of age have not been established. Use of azithromycin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia in pediatric patients (6 months of age or greater) is supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults. Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis: Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with pharyngitis/tonsillitis under years of age have not been established.. 8.5 Geriatric Use. In multiple-dose clinical trials of oral azithromycin, 9% of patients were at least 65 years of age (458/4949) and 3% of patients (144/4949) were at least 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions 5.4 )].",989174d7-4201-421f-a984-9d87b7f134e4,43684-0,USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS SECTION

In the rat carcinogenicity studies, animals were treated with oral doses ranging from 0.05 to 1000 mg/kg twice daily. The highest dose produced systemic exposures to aprepitant approximately equivalent to (female rats) or less than (male rats) the adult human exposure at the RHD of 150 mg. Treatment with aprepitant at doses of to 1000 mg/kg twice daily caused an increase in the incidences of thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas in male rats. In female rats, it produced hepatocellular adenomas at to 1000 mg/kg twice daily and hepatocellular carcinomas and thyroid follicular cell adenomas at 125 to 1000 mg/kg twice daily. In the mouse carcinogenicity studies, the animals were treated with oral doses ranging from 2.5 to 2000 mg/kg/day. The highest dose produced systemic exposure approximately times the adult human exposure at the RHD of 150 mg. Treatment with aprepitant produced skin fibrosarcomas at 125 and 500 mg/kg/day doses in male mice.

Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe escitalopram oxalate.. General Information about Medication GuidePrescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with escitalopram oxalate and should counsel them in its appropriate use. patient Medication Guide about Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions is available for escitalopram oxalate. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking escitalopram oxalate.. Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patients prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication see Warnings and Precautions 5.1) ]. Serotonin Syndrome Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of escitalopram oxalate with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone and St. Johns Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid) see Warnings and Precautions 5.2) ]. Abnormal Bleeding Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of escitalopram oxalate and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding see Warnings and Precautions 5.7) ]. Angle Closure GlaucomaPatients should be advised that taking escitalopram oxalate can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle glaucoma is not risk factor for angle closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle closure, and have prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible see Warnings and Precautions 5.9) ]. Concomitant MedicationsSince escitalopram is the active isomer of racemic citalopram (Celexa), the two agents should not be coadministered. Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, as there is potential for interactions.. Continuing the Therapy PrescribedWhile patients may notice improvement with escitalopram oxalate therapy in to weeks, they should be advised to continue therapy as directed.. Interference with Psychomotor PerformanceBecause psychoactive drugs may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that escitalopram oxalate therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.. AlcoholPatients should be told that, although escitalopram oxalate has not been shown in experiments with normal subjects to increase the mental and motor skill impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of escitalopram oxalate and alcohol in depressed patients is not advised.. Pregnancy and Breast FeedingPatients should be advised to notify their physician if theybecome pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy.are breastfeeding an infant.. become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy.. are breastfeeding an infant.. Need for Comprehensive Treatment ProgramEscitalopram oxalate is indicated as an integral part of total treatment program for MDD that may include other measures (psychological, educational, social) for patients with this syndrome. Drug treatment may not be indicated for all adolescents with this syndrome. Safety and effectiveness of escitalopram oxalate in MDD has not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age. Antidepressants are not intended for use in the adolescent who exhibits symptoms secondary to environmental factors and/or other primary psychiatric disorders. Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is often helpful. When remedial measures alone are insufficient, the decision to prescribe antidepressant medication will depend upon the physicians assessment of the chronicity and severity of the patients symptoms.Manufactured For: Accord Healthcare, Inc., 1009 Slater Road, Suite 210-B, Durham, NC 27703, USA.

28097926,"PRECAUTIONS SECTION. GeneralPatients already on beta-blocker must be evaluated carefully before atenolol is administered. Initial and subsequent atenolol dosages can be adjusted downward depending on clinical observations including pulse and blood pressure. Atenolol may aggravate peripheral arterial circulatory disorders.Impaired Renal FunctionThe drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). 1Based on the maximum dose of 100 mg/day in 50 kg patient.Drug InteractionsCatecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with atenolol plus catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.Calcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with atenolol (see WARNINGS). Disopyramide is Type antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia, asystole and heart failure when administered with beta-blockers.Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with beta-blockers.Beta-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta-blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of beta-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, e.g., indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.Information on concurrent usage of atenolol and aspirin is limited. Data from several studies, i.e., TIMI-II, ISIS-2, currently do not suggest any clinical interaction between aspirin and beta-blockers in the acute myocardial infarction setting.While taking beta-blockers, patients with history of anaphylactic reaction to variety of allergens may have more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction.Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of FertilityTwo long-term (maximum dosing duration of 18 or 24 months) rat studies and one long-term (maximum dosing duration of 18 months) mouse study, each employing dose levels as high as 300 mg/kg/day or 150 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose1, did not indicate carcinogenic potential of atenolol. third (24 month) rat study, employing doses of 500 and 1,500 mg/kg/day (250 and 750 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose1) resulted in increased incidences of benign adrenal medullary tumors in males and females, mammary fibroadenomas in females, and anterior pituitary adenomas and thyroid parafollicular cell carcinomas in males. No evidence of mutagenic potential of atenolol was uncovered in the dominant lethal test (mouse), in vivo cytogenetics test (Chinese hamster) or Ames test (S typhimurium).Fertility of male or female rats (evaluated at dose levels as high as 200 mg/kg/day or 100 times the maximum recommended human dose1) was unaffected by atenolol administration.Animal ToxicologyChronic studies employing oral atenolol performed in animals have revealed the occurrence of vacuolation of epithelial cells of Brunners glands in the duodenum of both male and female dogs at all tested dose levels of atenolol (starting at 15 mg/kg/day or 7.5 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose1) and increased incidence of atrial degeneration of hearts of male rats at 300 but not 150 mg atenolol/kg/day (150 and 75 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose1, respectively).Usage in PregnancyPregnancy Category DSee WARNINGS Pregnancy and Fetal Injury. 1Based on the maximum dose of 100 mg/day in 50 kg patient.Nursing MothersAtenolol is excreted in human breast milk at ratio of 1.5 to 6.8 when compared to the concentration in plasma. Caution should be exercised when atenolol is administered to nursing woman. Clinically significant bradycardia has been reported in breastfed infants. Premature infants, or infants with impaired renal function, may be more likely to develop adverse effects.Neonates born to mothers who are receiving atenolol at parturition or breastfeeding may be at risk for hypoglycemia and bradycardia. Caution should be exercised when atenolol is administered during pregnancy or to woman who is breastfeeding (see WARNINGS, Pregnancy and Fetal Injury). Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.Geriatric UseHypertension and Angina Pectoris Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis:Clinical studies of atenolol did not include sufficient number of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.Acute Myocardial Infarction:Of the 8,037 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction randomized to atenolol in the ISIS-1 trial (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY), 33% (2,644) were 65 years of age and older. It was not possible to identify significant differences in efficacy and safety between older and younger patients; however, elderly patients with systolic blood pressure 120 mm Hg seemed less likely to benefit (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

27898735,"WARNINGS. Hypertension and Angina. Cardiac Failure. Sympathetic stimulation is vital component supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure, and beta-blockade carries the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. In hypertensive and angina patients who have congestive heart failure controlled by digitalis and diuretics, metoprolol should be administered cautiously. In Patients Without History of Cardiac Failure. Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should be fully digitalized and/or given diuretic. The response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure continues, despite adequate digitalization and diuretic therapy, metoprolol should be withdrawn.. Ischemic Heart Disease:Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over period of to weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, metoprolol administration should be reinstated promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physicians advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue metoprolol therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension.. Bronchospastic Diseases. PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD, IN GENERAL, NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS, including metoprolol tartrate. Because of its relative beta1 selectivity, however, metoprolol may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Since beta1 selectivity is not absolute, beta2-stimulating agent should be administered concomitantly, and the lowest possible dose of metoprolol tartrate should be used. In these circumstances it would be prudent initially to administer metoprolol in smaller doses times daily, instead of larger doses times daily, to avoid the higher plasma levels associated with the longer dosing interval. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.). Major Surgery. The necessity or desirability of withdrawing beta-blocking therapy, including metoprolol tartrate, prior to major surgery is controversial; the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.Metoprolol, like other beta-blockers, is competitive inhibitor of beta-receptor agonists, and its effects can be reversed by administration of such agents, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. However, such patients may be subject to protracted severe hypotension. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heart beat has also been reported with beta-blockers.. Diabetes and Hypoglycemia. Metoprolol should be used with caution in diabetic patients if beta-blocking agent is required. Beta-blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected.. Pheochromocytoma. If metoprolol is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.. Thyrotoxicosis. Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade, which might precipitate thyroid storm.. Myocardial Infarction. Cardiac Failure. Sympathetic stimulation is vital component supporting circulatory function, and beta-blockade carries the potential hazard of depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating or exacerbating minimal cardiac failure.During treatment with metoprolol, the hemodynamic status of the patient should be carefully monitored. If heart failure occurs or persists despite appropriate treatment, metoprolol should be discontinued.. Bradycardia. Metoprolol produces decrease in sinus heart rate in most patients; this decrease is greatest among patients with high initial heart rates and least among patients with low initial heart rates. Acute myocardial infarction (particularly inferior infarction) may in itself produce significant lowering of the sinus rate. If the sinus rate decreases to 40 beats/min, particularly if associated with evidence of lowered cardiac output, atropine (0.25 mg to 0.5 mg) should be administered intravenously. If treatment with atropine is not successful, metoprolol should be discontinued, and cautious administration of isoproterenol or installation of cardiac pacemaker should be considered.. AV Block. Metoprolol slows AV conduction and may produce significant first- (P-R interval >= 0.26 sec), second-, or third-degree heart block. Acute myocardial infarction also produces heart block.If heart block occurs, metoprolol should be discontinued and atropine (0.25 mg to 0.5 mg) should be administered intravenously. If treatment with atropine is not successful, cautious administration of isoproterenol or installation of cardiac pacemaker should be considered.. Hypotension. If hypotension (systolic blood pressure <= 90 mmHg) occurs, metoprolol should be discontinued, and the hemodynamic status of the patient and the extent of myocardial damage carefully assessed. Invasive monitoring of central venous, pulmonary capillary wedge, and arterial pressures may be required. Appropriate therapy with fluids, positive inotropic agents, balloon counterpulsation, or other treatment modalities should be instituted. If hypotension is associated with sinus bradycardia or AV block, treatment should be directed at reversing these (see above).. Bronchospastic Diseases. PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD, IN GENERAL, NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS, including metoprolol tartrate. Because of its relative beta1 selectivity, metoprolol may be used with extreme caution in patients with bronchospastic disease. Because it is unknown to what extent beta2-stimulating agents may exacerbate myocardial ischemia and the extent of infarction, these agents should not be used prophylactically. If bronchospasm not related to congestive heart failure occurs, metoprolol should be discontinued. theophylline derivative or beta2 agonist may be administered cautiously, depending on the clinical condition of the patient. Both theophylline derivatives and beta2 agonists may produce serious cardiac arrhythmias.",17ed5d5c-074f-4a59-bde6-209b3df87221,34071-1,WARNINGS SECTION

28468713,"12.3 Pharmacokinetics. The sprinkle formulation is bioequivalent to the immediate-release tablet formulation and, therefore, may be substituted as therapeutic equivalent. Absorption of topiramate is rapid, with peak plasma concentrations occurring at approximately hours following 400 mg oral dose. The relative bioavailability of topiramate from the tablet formulation is about 80% compared to solution. The bioavailability of topiramate is not affected by food. The pharmacokinetics of topiramate are linear with dose proportional increases in plasma concentration over the dose range studied (200 to 800 mg/day). The mean plasma elimination half-life is 21 hours after single or multiple doses. Steady-state is thus reached in about days in patients with normal renal function. Topiramate is 15% to 41% bound to human plasma proteins over the blood concentration range of 0.5 to 250 mcg/mL. The fraction bound decreased as blood concentration increased. Carbamazepine and phenytoin do not alter the binding of topiramate. Sodium valproate, at 500 mcg/mL (a concentration to 10 times higher than considered therapeutic for valproate) decreased the protein binding of topiramate from 23% to 13%. Topiramate does not influence the binding of sodium valproate.Metabolism and Excretion Topiramate is not extensively metabolized and is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine (approximately 70% of an administered dose). Six metabolites have been identified in humans, none of which constitutes more than 5% of an administered dose. The metabolites are formed via hydroxylation, hydrolysis, and glucuronidation. There is evidence of renal tubular reabsorption of topiramate. In rats, given probenecid to inhibit tubular reabsorption, along with topiramate, significant increase in renal clearance of topiramate was observed. This interaction has not been evaluated in humans. Overall, oral plasma clearance (CL/F) is approximately 20 to 30 mL/min in adults following oral administration. Specific Populations Renal Impairment The clearance of topiramate was reduced by 42% in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 69 mL/min/1.73 2) and by 54% in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73 2) compared to subjects with normal renal function (creatinine clearance 70 mL/min/1.73 2) [see Dosage and Administration 2.4) and 2.5)] Hemodialysis Topiramate is cleared by hemodialysis. Using high-efficiency, counterflow, single pass-dialysate hemodialysis procedure, topiramate dialysis clearance was 120 mL/min with blood flow through the dialyzer at 400 mL/min. This high clearance (compared to 20 to 30 mL/min total oral clearance in healthy adults) will remove clinically significant amount of topiramate from the patient over the hemodialysis treatment period [see Dosage and Administration 2.6), Use in Specific Populations 8.7)] Hepatic Impairment Plasma clearance of topiramate decreased mean of 26% in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Age, Gender, and Race The pharmacokinetics of topiramate in elderly subjects (65 to 85 years of age, N=16) were evaluated in controlled clinical study. The elderly subject population had reduced renal function (creatinine clearance [-20%]) compared to young adults. Following single oral 100 mg dose, maximum plasma concentration for elderly and young adults was achieved at approximately to hours. Reflecting the primary renal elimination of topiramate, topiramate plasma and renal clearance were reduced 21% and 19%, respectively, in elderly subjects, compared to young adults. Similarly, topiramate half-life was longer (13%) in the elderly. Reduced topiramate clearance resulted in slightly higher maximum plasma concentration (23%) and AUC (25%) in elderly subjects than observed in young adults. Topiramate clearance is decreased in the elderly only to the extent that renal function is reduced [see Dosage and Administration 2.4) and Use in Specific Populations 8.5)] Clearance of topiramate in adults was not affected by gender or race. Pediatric Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics of topiramate were evaluated in patients age to 16 years. Patients received either no or combination of other antiepileptic drugs. population pharmacokinetic model was developed on the basis of pharmacokinetic data from relevant topiramate clinical studies. This dataset contained data from 1217 subjects including 258 pediatric patients age to 16 years (95 pediatric patients 10 years of age). Pediatric patients on adjunctive treatment exhibited higher oral clearance (L/h) of topiramate compared to patients on monotherapy, presumably because of increased clearance from concomitant enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs. In comparison, topiramate clearance per kg is greater in pediatric patients than in adults and in young pediatric patients (down to years) than in older pediatric patients. Consequently, the plasma drug concentration for the same mg/kg/day dose would be lower in pediatric patients compared to adults and also in younger pediatric patients compared to older pediatric patients. Clearance was independent of dose. As in adults, hepatic enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs decrease the steady state plasma concentrations of topiramate. Drug InteractionsIn vitro studies indicate that topiramate does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5 isozymes. In vitro studies indicate that topiramate is mild inhibitor of CYP2C19 and mild inducer of CYP3A4. Antiepileptic Drugs Potential interactions between topiramate and standard AEDs were assessed in controlled clinical pharmacokinetic studies in patients with epilepsy. The effects of these interactions on mean plasma AUCs are summarized in Table 10. In Table 10, the second column (AED concentration) describes what happens to the concentration of the co-administered AED listed in the first column when topiramate is added. The third column (topiramate concentration) describes how the co-administration of drug listed in the first column modifies the concentration of topiramate when compared to topiramate given alone.Table 10: Summary of AED Interactions with Topiramatea Plasma concentration increased 25% in some patients, generally those on twice day dosing regimen of phenytoin. = Is not administered but is an active metabolite of carbamazepine.

In another study, exposure to EE was statistically significantly decreased at doses of 200, 400, and 800 mg/day (18%, 21%, and 30%, respectively) when given as adjunctive therapy in patients taking valproic acid. In both studies, topiramate (50 mg/day to 800 mg/day) did not significantly affect exposure to NET and there was no significant dose-dependent change in EE exposure for doses of 50 to 200 mg/day. The clinical significance of the changes observed is not known [see Drug Interactions 7.4)] DigoxinIn single-dose study, serum digoxin AUC was decreased by 12% with concomitant topiramate administration. The clinical relevance of this observation has not been established.Hydrochlorothiazide drug interaction study conducted in healthy volunteers evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (25 mg every 24 hours) and topiramate (96 mg every 12 hours) when administered alone and concomitantly. The results of this study indicate that topiramate max increased by 27% and AUC increased by 29% when HCTZ was added to topiramate. The clinical significance of this change is unknown. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of HCTZ were not significantly influenced by the concomitant administration of topiramate. Clinical laboratory results indicated decreases in serum potassium after topiramate or HCTZ administration, which were greater when HCTZ and topiramate were administered in combination. Metformin drug interaction study conducted in healthy volunteers evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of metformin (500 mg every 12 hours) and topiramate in plasma when metformin was given alone and when metformin and topiramate (100 mg every 12 hours) were given simultaneously. The results of this study indicated that the mean metformin max and AUC to 12h increased by 18% and 25%, respectively, when topiramate was added. Topiramate did not affect metformin max. The clinical significance of the effect of topiramate on metformin pharmacokinetics is not known. Oral plasma clearance of topiramate appears to be reduced when administered with metformin. The clinical significance of the effect of metformin on topiramate pharmacokinetics is unclear. Pioglitazone drug interaction study conducted in healthy volunteers evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of topiramate and pioglitazone when administered alone and concomitantly. 15% decrease in the AUC ,ss of pioglitazone with no alteration in max,ss was observed. This finding was not statistically significant. In addition, 13% and 16% decrease in max,ss and AUC ,ss respectively, of the active hydroxy-metabolite was noted as well as 60% decrease in max,ss and AUC ,ss of the active keto-metabolite. The clinical significance of these findings is not known. Glyburide drug-drug interaction study conducted in patients with type diabetes evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of glyburide (5 mg/day) alone and concomitantly with topiramate (150 mg/day). There was 22% decrease in max and 25% reduction in AUC 24 for glyburide during topiramate administration. Systemic exposure (AUC) of the active metabolites, 4- trans-hydroxy-glyburide (M1) and 3- cis-hydroxyglyburide (M2), was also reduced by 13% and 15%, and max was reduced by 18% and 25%, respectively. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of topiramate were unaffected by concomitant administration of glyburide. Lithium In patients, the pharmacokinetics of lithium were unaffected during treatment with topiramate at doses of 200 mg/day; however, there was an observed increase in systemic exposure of lithium (27% for max and 26% for AUC) following topiramate doses up to 600 mg/day [see Drug Interactions 7.7)] Haloperidol The pharmacokinetics of single dose of haloperidol (5 mg) were not affected following multiple dosing of topiramate (100 mg every 12 hr) in 13 healthy adults (6 males, females). Amitriptyline There was 12% increase in AUC and max for amitriptyline (25 mg per day) in 18 healthy subjects (9 males, females) receiving 200 mg/day of topiramate. Sumatriptan Multiple dosing of topiramate (100 mg every 12 hours) in 24 healthy volunteers (14 males, 10 females) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of single-dose sumatriptan either orally (100 mg) or subcutaneously (6 mg).Risperidone When administered concomitantly with topiramate at escalating doses of 100, 250, and 400 mg/day, there was reduction in risperidone systemic exposure (16% and 33% for steady-state AUC at the 250 and 400 mg/day doses of topiramate). No alterations of 9-hydroxyrisperidone levels were observed. Co-administration of topiramate 400 mg/day with risperidone resulted in 14% increase in max and 12% increase in AUC 12 of topiramate. There were no clinically significant changes in the systemic exposure of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone or of topiramate; therefore, this interaction is not likely to be of clinical significance. Propranolol Multiple dosing of topiramate (200 mg/day) in 34 healthy volunteers (17 males, 17 females) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of propranolol following daily 160 mg doses. Propranolol doses of 160 mg/day in 39 volunteers (27 males, 12 females) had no effect on the exposure to topiramate, at dose of 200 mg/day of topiramate. Dihydroergotamine Multiple dosing of topiramate (200 mg/day) in 24 healthy volunteers (12 males, 12 females) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of 1 mg subcutaneous dose of dihydroergotamine. Similarly, 1 mg subcutaneous dose of dihydroergotamine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of 200 mg/day dose of topiramate in the same study. Diltiazem Co-administration of diltiazem (240 mg Cardizem CD (R)) with topiramate (150 mg/day) resulted in 10% decrease in max and 25% decrease in diltiazem AUC, 27% decrease in max and an 18% decrease in des-acetyl diltiazem AUC, and no effect on N-desmethyl diltiazem. Co-administration of topiramate with diltiazem resulted in 16% increase in max and 19% increase in AUC 12 of topiramate. Venlafaxine Multiple dosing of topiramate (150 mg/day) in healthy volunteers did not affect the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine or O-desmethyl venlafaxine. Multiple dosing of venlafaxine (150 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of topiramate.",86b0ef4e-aaf4-4f37-b576-bc11c3e0bf08,43682-4,PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION

For oral medication where reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have narrow therapeutic range.

28318178,"14 CLINICAL STUDIES. 14.1 Treatment of Influenza. AdultsTwo randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of oseltamivir phosphate were conducted in adults between 18 and 65 years old, one in the U.S. and one outside the U.S., for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Eligible subjects had fever of at least 100oF, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom (cough, nasal symptoms, or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue, or headache), and influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Subjects were randomized to receive oral oseltamivir phosphate or placebo for days. All enrolled subjects were allowed to take fever-reducing medications.Of 1,355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) subjects were influenza-infected (median age 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Of the 849 influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with influenza of unknown type.Study medication was started within 40 hours of onset of symptoms and administered twice daily for days. Subjects were required to self-assess the influenza-associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as none, mild, moderate, or severe. Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms were assessed as none or mild. In both trials, there was 1.3-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice day for days compared to subjects who received placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in men and women.In the treatment of influenza, no increased efficacy was demonstrated in subjects who received higher doses of oseltamivir phosphate.Adolescents and Adults with Chronic Cardiac or Respiratory DiseaseA double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial was unable to demonstrate efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate (75 mg twice daily for days) in the treatment of influenza in adult and adolescent subjects (13 years or older) with chronic cardiac (excluding chronic idiopathic hypertension) or respiratory diseases, as measured by time to alleviation of all symptoms. However, in patients treated with oseltamivir phosphate there was more rapid cessation of febrile illness. No difference in the incidence of influenza complications was observed between the treatment and placebo groups in this population.Geriatric SubjectsThree double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trials were conducted in subjects who were at least 65 years of age in three consecutive seasons. The enrollment criteria were similar to that of adult trials with the exception of fever being defined as higher than 97.5F. Of 741 subjects enrolled, 476 (65%) subjects were influenza-infected; of these, 95% were infected with influenza type and 5% with influenza type B.In the pooled analysis, there was 1-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice daily for days compared to those who received placebo (p=NS) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Some seasonal variability was noted in the clinical efficacy outcomes. Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)One double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trial was conducted in pediatric subjects aged year to 12 years (median age years) who had fever (at least 100oF) plus one respiratory symptom (cough or coryza) when influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Of 698 subjects enrolled in this trial, 452 (65%) were influenza-infected (50% male; 68% Caucasian). Of the 452 influenza-infected subjects, 67% were infected with influenza and 33% with influenza B.Efficacy in this trial was determined by the time to alleviation or resolution of influenza signs and symptoms, measured by composite endpoint that required the following four individual conditions be met: i) alleviation of cough, ii) alleviation of coryza, iii) resolution of fever, and iv) parental opinion of return to normal health and activity. Oseltamivir phosphate treatment of mg per kg twice daily, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, reduced the total composite time to freedom from illness by 1.5 days compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in male and female pediatric subjects.Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than year of age)Two open-label trials evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in influenza-infected pediatric subjects weeks to less than year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age). Subjects received oseltamivir phosphate at doses ranging from to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for days depending on subject age. These clinical trials were not designed to evaluate clinical efficacy or virologic response.Of the 136 subjects under the age of year enrolled and dosed in the trials, the majority of the subjects were male (55%), white (79%), non-Hispanic (74%), full term (76%) and infected with influenza (80%). Pharmacokinetic data indicated that dose of mg per kg twice daily in pediatric subjects weeks to less than year of age provided oseltamivir phosphate concentrations similar to or higher than those observed in older pediatric subjects and adults receiving the approved dose and provided the basis for approval [see dverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 14.2 Prophylaxis of Influenza. Adult and Adolescent Subjects (13 years of age and older)The efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness has been demonstrated in three seasonal prophylaxis (community outbreak) clinical trials and one post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts. The efficacy endpoint for all of these trials was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza defined as meeting all the following criteria (all signs and symptoms must have been recorded within24 hours):oral temperature greater than or equal to 99oF (37.2oC),at least one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, nasal congestion),at least one constitutional symptom (aches and pain, fatigue, headache, chills/sweats), andeither positive virus isolation or four-fold increase in virus antibody titers from baseline.In pooled analysis of two seasonal prophylaxis trials in healthy unvaccinated adults (aged 18 to 65 years), oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg once daily taken for 42 days during community outbreak reduced the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza from 5% (25/519) for the placebo group to 1% (6/520) for the oseltamivir phosphate group.In the seasonal (community outbreak) prophylaxis trial in elderly residents of skilled nursing homes, about 80%, 43%, and 14% of the subjects were vaccinated, had cardiac disorders, and had chronic airway obstructive disorders, respectively. In this trial, subjects were randomized to oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg once daily or placebo taken orally for 42 days. The incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was 4% (12/272) in the placebo-treated subjects compared to less than 1% (1/276) in the oseltamivir phosphate-treated subjects.In the post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts (aged 13 years or older) of an index influenza case, oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg once daily or placebo taken orally was administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms in the index case and continued for days (index cases did not receive oseltamivir phosphate treatment). The incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was 12% (24/200) in the placebo-treated subjects compared to 1% (2/205) in the oseltamivir phosphate-treated subjects.Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)The efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness was demonstrated in randomized, open-label post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts that included pediatric subjects aged year to 12 years, both as index cases and as family contacts. All index cases in this trial received oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension 30 to 60 mg taken orally once daily for 10 days. The efficacy parameter was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in the household. Laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was defined as meeting all of the following criteria:oral temperature at least 100F (37.8C),cough and/or coryza recorded within 48 hours, andeither positive virus isolation or four-fold or greater increase in virus antibody titers from baseline or at illness visits.Among household contacts year to 12 years of age not already shedding virus at baseline, the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was lower in the group who received oseltamivir phosphate prophylaxis [3% (3/95)] compared to the group who did not receive oseltamivir phosphate prophylaxis [17% (18/106)].Immunocompromised SubjectsA double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted for seasonal prophylaxis of influenza in 475 immunocompromised subjects (including 18 pediatric subjects year to 12 years of age) who had received solid organ (n=388; liver, kidney, liver and kidney) or hematopoietic stem cell transplants (n=87). Median time since transplant for solid organ transplant recipients was 1,105 days for the placebo group and 1,379 days for the oseltamivir phosphate group. Median time since transplant for hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients was 424 days for the placebo group and 367 days for the oseltamivir phosphate group. Approximately 40% of subjects received influenza vaccine prior to entering the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of confirmed clinical influenza, defined as oral temperature higher than 99F (37.2C) plus cough and/or coryza, all recorded within 24 hours, plus either positive virus culture or four-fold increase in virus antibody titers from baseline. Subjects received treatment with oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg or placebo once daily by mouth for 12 weeks. The incidence of confirmed clinical influenza was 3% (7/238) in the placebo group compared with 2% (5/237) in the oseltamivir phosphate group; this difference was not statistically significant. secondary analysis was performed using the same clinical symptoms and RT-PCR for laboratory confirmation of influenza infection. Among subjects who were not already shedding virus at baseline, the incidence of RT-PCR-confirmed clinical influenza infection was 3% (7/231) in the placebo group and <1% (1/232) in the oseltamivir phosphate group.. oral temperature greater than or equal to 99oF (37.2oC),. at least one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, nasal congestion),. at least one constitutional symptom (aches and pain, fatigue, headache, chills/sweats), and. either positive virus isolation or four-fold increase in virus antibody titers from baseline.. oral temperature at least 100F (37.8C),. cough and/or coryza recorded within 48 hours, and. either positive virus isolation or four-fold or greater increase in virus antibody titers from baseline or at illness visits.",c61bb5af-558f-4b32-b34d-8fdae480443c,34092-7,CLINICAL STUDIES SECTION

27940169,"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of levofloxacin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, levofloxacin tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for the treatment of adults (>= 18 years of age) with mild, moderate, and severe infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed in this section.Culture and susceptibility testingAppropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing the infection and to determine their susceptibility to levofloxacin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]. Therapy with levofloxacin may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available, appropriate therapy should be selected.As with other drugs in this class, some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with levofloxacin. Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy will provide information about the continued susceptibility of the pathogens to the antimicrobial agent and also the possible emergence of bacterial resistance.. Levofloxacin tablets are fluoroquinolone antibacterial indicated in adults (>= 18 years of age) with infections caused by designated, susceptible bacteria (1, 12.4).Pneumonia: nosocomial (1.1) and community acquired (1.2, 1.3)Acute bacterial sinusitis (1.4)Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (1.5)Skin and skin structure infections: complicated (1.6) and uncomplicated (1.7)Chronic bacterial prostatitis (1.8)Urinary tract infections: complicated (1.9, 1.10) and uncomplicated (1.12)Acute pyelonephritis (1.11)Inhalational anthrax, post-exposure (1.13). Not tested in humans for post-exposure prevention of inhalational anthrax; plasma concentrations are likely to predict efficacy (14.9). Pneumonia: nosocomial (1.1) and community acquired (1.2, 1.3). Acute bacterial sinusitis (1.4). Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (1.5). Skin and skin structure infections: complicated (1.6) and uncomplicated (1.7). Chronic bacterial prostatitis (1.8). Urinary tract infections: complicated (1.9, 1.10) and uncomplicated (1.12). Acute pyelonephritis (1.11). Inhalational anthrax, post-exposure (1.13). Not tested in humans for post-exposure prevention of inhalational anthrax; plasma concentrations are likely to predict efficacy (14.9). 1.1 Nosocomial Pneumonia. Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Adjunctive therapy should be used as clinically indicated. Where Pseudomonas aeruginosa is documented or presumptive pathogen, combination therapy with an anti-pseudomonal -lactam is recommended [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].. 1.2 Community-Acquired Pneumonia: to 14 Day Treatment Regimen. Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multi-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [MDRSP]), Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, or Mycoplasma pneumoniae [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].MDRSP isolates are strains resistant to two or more of the following antibacterials: penicillin (MIC >= mcg/mL), 2nd generation cephalosporins, e.g., cefuroxime, macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.. 1.3 Community-Acquired Pneumonia: Day Treatment Regimen. Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (excluding multi-drug-resistant strains [MDRSP]), Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Chlamydophila pneumoniae [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Studies (14.3)].. 1.4 Acute Bacterial Sinusitis: Day and 10 to 14 Day Treatment Regimens. Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].. 1.5 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis. Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis.. 1.6 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections. Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Proteus mirabilis [see Clinical Studies (14.5)].. 1.7 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections. Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (mild to moderate) including abscesses, cellulitis, furuncles, impetigo, pyoderma, wound infections, due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. 1.8 Chronic Bacterial Prostatitis. Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis due to Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, or methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].. 1.9 Complicated Urinary Tract Infections: Day Treatment Regimen. Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis [see Clinical Studies (14.7)].. 1.10 Complicated Urinary Tract Infections: 10 Day Treatment Regimen. Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (mild to moderate) due to Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa [see Clinical Studies (14.8)].. 1.11 Acute Pyelonephritis: or 10 Day Treatment Regimen. Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis caused by Escherichia coli, including cases with concurrent bacteremia [see Clinical Studies (14.7, 14.8)].. 1.12 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections. Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (mild to moderate) due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Staphylococcus saprophyticus.. 1.13 Inhalational Anthrax (Post-Exposure). Levofloxacin tablets are indicated for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) to reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis. The effectiveness of levofloxacin tablets is based on plasma concentrations achieved in humans, surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Levofloxacin tablets have not been tested in humans for the post-exposure prevention of inhalation anthrax. The safety of levofloxacin tablets in adults for durations of therapy beyond 28 days or in pediatric patients for durations of therapy beyond 14 days has not been studied. Prolonged levofloxacin tablet therapy should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2) and Clinical Studies (14.9)].",398348ed-1b65-4109-9d0f-f9d8a7175d61,34067-9,INDICATIONS & USAGE SECTION

28683392,"8.4 Pediatric Use. The safety and effectiveness of oral olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder were established in short-term studies in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years). Use of olanzapine in adolescents is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of olanzapine in which 268 adolescents received olanzapine in range of 2.5 to 20 mg/day [see Clinical Studies 14.1, 14.2)] Recommended starting dose for adolescents is lower than that for adults [see Dosage and Administration 2.1, 2.2)] Compared to patients from adult clinical trials, adolescents were likely to gain more weight, experience increased sedation, and have greater increases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, prolactin and hepatic aminotransferase levels [see Warnings and Precautions 5.5, 5.15, 5.17) and Adverse Reactions 6.1)] When deciding among the alternative treatments available for adolescents, clinicians should consider the increased potential (in adolescents as compared with adults) for weight gain and dyslipidemia. Clinicians should consider the potential long-term risks when prescribing to adolescents, and in many cases this may lead them to consider prescribing other drugs first in adolescents [see Indications and Usage 1.1, 1.2)] Safety and effectiveness of olanzapine in children <13 years of age have not been established [see Patient Counseling Information 17)]. Safety and efficacy of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) have been established for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder.Safety and effectiveness of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination in children <10 years of age have not been established.",a1dfb4e7-4143-4422-b7a7-292e4fd75044,34081-0,PEDIATRIC USE SECTION

To minimize the risk of seizure, increase the dose gradually [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) should be swallowed whole and not crushed, divided, or chewed. Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) should be administered in the morning and may be taken with or without food.. 2.2 Dosage for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The recommended starting dose for MDD is 150 mg once daily in the morning. After days of dosing, the dose may be increased to the target dose of 300 mg once daily in the morning.It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of antidepressant treatment beyond the response in the acute episode. It is unknown whether the bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) dose needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose that provided an initial response. Periodically reassess the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment.. 2.3 Dosage for Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). The recommended starting dose for SAD is 150 mg once daily. After days of dosing, the dose may be increased to the target dose of 300 mg once daily in the morning. Doses above 300 mg of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release were not assessed in the SAD trials.For the prevention of seasonal MDD episodes associated with SAD, initiate bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) in the autumn, prior to the onset of depressive symptoms. Continue treatment through the winter season. Taper and discontinue bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) in early spring. For patients treated with 300 mg per day, decrease the dose to 150 mg once daily before discontinuing bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL). Individualize the timing of initiation, and duration of treatment should be individualized, based on the patients historical pattern of seasonal MDD episodes.. 2.4 Switching Patients from WELLBUTRIN (R) Tablets (bupropion hydrochloride tablets) or from WELLBUTRIN SR (R) Sustained-Release Tablets (bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR). When switching patients from WELLBUTRIN (R) Tablets (bupropion hydrochloride tablets) to bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) or from WELLBUTRIN SR (R) Sustained-Release Tablets (bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR)) to bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL), give the same total daily dose when possible. 2.5 To Discontinue Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (XL), Taper the Dose. When discontinuing treatment in patients treated with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) 300 mg once daily, decrease the dose to 150 mg once daily prior to discontinuation.. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Hepatic Impairment. In patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: to 15), the maximum dose is 150 mg every other day. In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: to 6), consider reducing the dose and/or frequency of dosing [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.7 Dose Adjustment in Patients with Renal Impairment. Consider reducing the dose and/or frequency of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) in patients with renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate less than 90 mL/min) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.8 Switching Patient to or from Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Antidepressant. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat depression and initiation of therapy with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL). Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) before starting an MAOI antidepressant [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) and Drug Interactions (7.6)]. 2.9 Use of Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (XL) with Reversible MAOIs such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue. Do not start bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) in patient who is being treated with reversible MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. Drug interactions can increase risk of hypertensive reactions. In patient who requires more urgent treatment of psychiatric condition, non-pharmacological interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. In some cases, patient already receiving therapy with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of hypertensive reactions in particular patient, bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than mg per kg with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) is unclear.

28951168,"8.1 Pregnancy. Risk SummaryThe limited available data with JANUMET in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [see Data]. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations]. No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC. No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 2- and 6-times, respectively, 2000 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area [see Data].The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20% respectively. Clinical Considerations. Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal RiskPoorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data. Human DataPublished data from post-marketing studies do not report clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups.. Animal Data. Sitagliptin and MetforminNo animal reproduction studies were conducted with the coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin.. SitagliptinIn embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits.Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg.. MetforminMetformin did not cause adverse developmental effects when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits up to 600 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. This represents an exposure of about 2- and 6-times 2000 mg clinical dose based on body surface area (mg/m2) for rats and rabbits, respectively.",b55ee3d9-7f0b-4dd9-9213-fbc69f09f567,42228-7,PREGNANCY SECTION

28937676,"12.3 Pharmacokinetics. Absorption and DistributionFollowing oral administration, tizanidine is essentially completely absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is approximately 40% (CV 24%), due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. Tizanidine is extensively distributed throughout the body with mean steady state volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg (CV 21%) following intravenous administration in healthy adult volunteers. Tizanidine is approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins.Differences between Tizanidine Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets, USPTizanidine Capsules and Tizanidine Tablets, USP are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions, but not under fed conditions. single dose of either two mg tablets or two mg capsules was administered under fed and fasting conditions in an open label, four period, randomized crossover study in 96 human volunteers, of whom 81 were eligible for the statistical analysis. Following oral administration of either the tablet or capsule (in the fasted state), peak plasma concentrations of tizanidine occurred 1.0 hours after dosing with half-life of approximately hours. When two mg tablets were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was increased by approximately 30%, and the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased by 25 minutes, to hour and 25 minutes. In contrast, when two mg capsules were administered with food, the mean maximal plasma concentration was decreased by 20%, the median time to peak plasma concentration was increased to hours. Consequently, the mean max for the capsule when administered with food is approximately 66% the max for the tablet when administered with food. Food also increased the extent of absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase with the tablet (~30%) was significantly greater than with the capsule (~10%). Consequently when each was administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet. Administration of the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was not bioequivalent to administration of an intact capsule under fasting conditions. Administration of the capsule contents on applesauce resulted in 15%-20% increase in max and AUC of tizanidine and 15 minute decrease in the median lag time and time to peak concentration compared to administration of an intact capsule while fasting. Figure 1: Mean Tizanidine Concentration vs. Time Profiles For Tizanidine Tablets, USP and Capsules (2 4 mg) Under Fasted and Fed ConditionsMetabolism and ExcretionTizanidine has linear pharmacokinetics over the doses studied in clinical development (1-20 mg). Tizanidine has half-life of approximately 2.5 hours (CV=33%). Approximately 95% of an administered dose is metabolized. The primary cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved in tizanidine metabolism is CYP1A2. Tizanidine metabolites are not known to be active; their half-lives range from 20 to 40 hours.Following single and multiple oral dosing of 14C-tizanidine, an average of 60% and 20% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively.Special PopulationsAge EffectsNo specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate age effects. Cross study comparison of pharmacokinetic data following single dose administration of mg Tizanidine Tablets, USP showed that younger subjects cleared the drug four times faster than the elderly subjects. Tizanidine Tablets, USP has not been evaluated in children. see Use in Specific Populations 8.4, 8.5) Hepatic ImpairmentThe influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine has not been evaluated. Because tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant effects on pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Tizanidine Tablets, USP is not recommended in this patient population see Use in Specific Populations 8.7) Renal ImpairmentTizanidine clearance is reduced by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 25 mL/min) compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to longer duration of clinical effect. Tizanidine Tablets, USP should be used with caution in renally impaired patients see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Use in Specific Populations 8.6)]. Gender EffectsNo specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate gender effects. Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data, however, following single and multiple dose administration of mg Tizanidine Tablets, USP showed that gender had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine.Race EffectsPharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied.Drug InteractionsCYP1A2 InhibitorsThe interaction between Tizanidine Tablets, USP and either fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin is most likely due to inhibition of CYP1A2 by fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. The effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of single mg dose of Tizanidine Tablets, USP was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The max, AUC, and half-life of tizanidine increased by 12-fold, 33-fold, and 3-fold, respectively. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the pharmacokinetics of single mg dose of Tizanidine Tablets, USP was studied in 10 healthy subjects. The max and AUC of tizanidine increased by 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively. see Contraindications (4)] Although there have been no clinical studies evaluating the effects of other CYP1A2 inhibitors on tizanidine, other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, other fluoroquinolones, antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine oral contraceptives, acyclovir and ticlopidine, may also lead to substantial increases in tizanidine blood concentrations see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. In vitro studies of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using human liver microsomes indicate that neither tizanidine nor the major metabolites are likely to affect the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.Oral ContraceptivesNo specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate interaction between oral contraceptives and Tizanidine Tablets, USP. Retrospective analysis of population pharmacokinetic data following single and multiple dose administration of mg Tizanidine Tablets, USP, however, showed that women concurrently taking oral contraceptives had 50% lower clearance of tizanidine compared to women not on oral contraceptives see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Acetaminophen Tizanidine delayed the max of acetaminophen by 16 minutes. Acetaminophen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine. Alcohol Alcohol increased the AUC of tizanidine by approximately 20%, while also increasing its max by approximately 15%. This was associated with an increase in side effects of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Tizanidine-2.",fdf4f09d-4537-a438-e053-6394a90a573d,43682-4,PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION

Administer phytonadione injectable emulsion by the subcutaneous route, whenever possible. (2.1). When intravenous administration is unavoidable, inject the drug very slowly, not exceeding mg per minute. (2.1). 2.1 Dosing Considerations. Whenever possible, administer phytonadione injectable emulsion by the subcutaneous route [see Boxed Warning]. When intravenous administration is unavoidable, inject the drug very slowly, not exceeding mg per minute [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].Monitor international normalized ratio (INR) regularly and as clinical conditions indicate. Use the lowest effective dose of phytonadione injectable emulsion.The coagulant effects of phytonadione injectable emulsion are not immediate; improvement of INR may take 1-8 hours. Interim use of whole blood or component therapy may also be necessary if bleeding is severe.Whenever possible, administer benzyl alcohol-free formulations in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].When phytonadione injectable emulsion is used to correct excessive anticoagulant-induced hypoprothrombinemia, anticoagulant therapy still being indicated, the patient is again faced with the clotting hazards existing prior to starting the anticoagulant therapy. Phytonadione is not clotting agent, but overzealous therapy with phytonadione injectable emulsion may restore conditions which originally permitted thromboembolic phenomena. Dosage should be kept as low as possible, and INR should be checked regularly as clinical conditions indicate.. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Coagulation Disorders from Vitamin Deficiency or Interference. The recommended dosage of phytonadione injectable emulsion is based on whether the hypoprothrombinemia is anticoagulant-induced (e.g., due to coumarin or indanedione derivatives) or non-anticoagulant-induced (e.g., due to antibiotics; salicylates or other drugs; factors limiting absorption or synthesis) as follows:Anticoagulant-Induced Hypoprothrombinemia: Phytonadione injectable emulsion 2.5 mg to 10 mg or more subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. Up to 25 mg to 50 mg may be administered as single dose.Repeated large doses of phytonadione injectable emulsion are not warranted in liver disease if the initial response is unsatisfactory. Failure to respond to phytonadione injectable emulsion may indicate that the condition being treated is inherently unresponsive to phytonadione injectable emulsion.Hypoprothrombinemia Due to Other Causes (Non-Anticoagulation-Induced Hypoprothrombinemia): Phytonadione injectable emulsion 2.5 mg to 25 mg or more intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. Up to 50 mg may be administered as single dose.Evaluate INR after 6-8 hours, and repeat dose if INR remains prolonged. Modify subsequent dosage (amount and frequency) based on the INR or clinical condition.. Anticoagulant-Induced Hypoprothrombinemia: Phytonadione injectable emulsion 2.5 mg to 10 mg or more subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. Up to 25 mg to 50 mg may be administered as single dose.. Hypoprothrombinemia Due to Other Causes (Non-Anticoagulation-Induced Hypoprothrombinemia): Phytonadione injectable emulsion 2.5 mg to 25 mg or more intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. Up to 50 mg may be administered as single dose.. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Prophylaxis and Treatment of Vitamin Deficiency Bleeding in Neonates. Prophylaxis of Vitamin K-Deficiency Bleeding in NeonatesThe recommended dosage of phytonadione injectable emulsion is 0.5 mg to mg within one hour of birth for single dose.Treatment of Vitamin Deficiency Bleeding in NeonatesThe recommended dosage of phytonadione injectable emulsion is mg given either subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Consider higher doses if the mother has been receiving oral anticoagulants.A failure to respond (shortening of the INR in to hours) may indicate another diagnosis or coagulation disorder.. 2.4 Directions for Dilution. Dilute phytonadione injectable emulsion with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, 5% Dextrose Injection, or 5% Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection. Avoid use of other diluents that may contain benzyl alcohol, which can cause serious toxicity in newborns or low birth weight infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].When diluted, start administration of phytonadione injectable emulsion immediately after dilution.Discard unused portions of diluted solution as well as unused contents of the vial.Protect phytonadione injectable emulsion from light at all times.Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.",1add4de5-0f9c-453e-9dd5-abb8077b566a,34068-7,DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION SECTION

28285758,"OVERDOSAGE. Approximately 1/2 hours after the reported ingestion of from to 10 ibuprofen tablets (400 mg), 19-month old child weighing 12 kg was seen in the hospital emergency room, apneic and cyanotic, responding only to painful stimuli. This type of stimulus, however, was sufficient to induce respiration. Oxygen and parenteral fluids were given; greenish-yellow fluid was aspirated from the stomach with no evidence to indicate the presence of ibuprofen. Two hours after ingestion the childs condition seemed stable; she still responded only to painful stimuli and continued to have periods of apnea lasting from to 10 seconds. She was admitted to intensive care and sodium bicarbonate was administered as well as infusions of dextrose and normal saline. By four hours post-ingestion she could be aroused easily, sit by herself and respond to spoken commands. Blood level of ibuprofen was 102.9 mcg/mL approximately 1/2 hours after accidental ingestion. At 12 hours she appeared to be completely recovered.In two other reported cases where children (each weighing approximately 10 kg) accidentally, acutely ingested approximately 120 mg/kg, there were no signs of acute intoxication or late sequelae. Blood level in one child 90 minutes after ingestion was 700 mcg/mL -- about 10 times the peak levels seen in absorption-excretion studies. 19-year old male who had taken 8,000 mg of ibuprofen over period of few hours complained of dizziness, and nystagmus was noted. After hospitalization, parenteral hydration and three days bed rest, he recovered with no reported sequelae.In cases of acute overdosage, the stomach should be emptied by vomiting or lavage, though little drug will likely be recovered if more than an hour has elapsed since ingestion. Because the drug is acidic and is excreted in the urine, it is theoretically beneficial to administer alkali and induce diuresis. In addition to supportive measures, the use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption and reabsorption of ibuprofen tablets.",8813a8a4-ebbd-4204-88a3-600a92ea9170,34088-5,OVERDOSAGE SECTION

Because nifedipine decreases peripheral vascular resistance, careful monitoring of blood pressure during the initial administration and titration of nifedipine is suggested. Close observation is especially recommended for patients already taking medications that are known to lower blood pressure (see WARNINGS). Peripheral Edema. Mild to moderate peripheral edema occurs in dose dependent manner with an incidence ranging from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). It is localized phenomenon thought to be associated with vasodilation of dependent arterioles and small blood vessels and not due to left ventricular dysfunction or generalized fluid retention. With patients whose angina or hypertension is complicated by congestive heart failure, care should be taken to differentiate this peripheral edema from the effects of increasing left ventricular dysfunction.. Information for Patients. Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets should be swallowed whole. Do not chew, divide or crush tablets. Do not be concerned if you occasionally notice in your stool something that looks like tablet. In Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets, the medication is contained within nonabsorbable shell that has been specially designed to slowly release the drug for your body to absorb. When this process is completed, the empty tablet is eliminated from your body.. Laboratory Tests. Rare, usually transient, but occasionally significant elevations of enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, CPK, LDH, SGOT and SGPT have been noted. The relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain in most cases, but probable in some. These laboratory abnormalities have rarely been associated with clinical symptoms; however, cholestasis with or without jaundice has been reported. small (5.4%) increase in mean alkaline phosphatase was noted in patients treated with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets. This was an isolated finding not associated with clinical symptoms and it rarely resulted in values which fell outside the normal range. Rare instances of allergic hepatitis have been reported. In controlled studies, Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets did not adversely affect serum uric acid, glucose, or cholesterol. Serum potassium was unchanged in patients receiving Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets in the absence of concomitant diuretic therapy, and slightly decreased in patients receiving concomitant diuretics.Nifedipine, like other calcium channel blockers, decreases platelet aggregation in vitro. Limited clinical studies have demonstrated moderate but statistically significant decrease in platelet aggregation and an increase in bleeding time in some nifedipine patients. This is thought to be function of inhibition of calcium transport across the platelet membrane. No clinical significance for these findings has been demonstrated. Positive direct Coombs test with/without hemolytic anemia has been reported, but causal relationship between nifedipine administration and positivity of this laboratory test, including hemolysis, could not be determined.Although nifedipine has been used safely in patients with renal dysfunction and has been reported to exert beneficial effect, in certain cases, rare, reversible elevations in BUN and serum creatinine have been reported in patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency. The relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain in most cases but probable in some.. Drug Interactions. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents. (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and WARNINGS.) Experience in over 1400 patients with nifedipine capsules in noncomparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina. Long-acting Nitrates. Nifedipine may be safely co-administered with nitrates, but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the antianginal effectiveness of this combination.. Digitalis. Administration of nifedipine with digoxin increased digoxin levels in nine of twelve normal volunteers. The average increase was 45%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in thirteen patients with coronary artery disease. In an uncontrolled study of over two hundred patients with congestive heart failure during which digoxin blood levels were not measured, digitalis toxicity was not observed. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.. Coumarin Anticoagulants. There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain.. Cimetidine. study in six healthy volunteers has shown significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%), after one week course of cimetidine at 1000 mg per day and nifedipine at 40 mg per day. Ranitidine produced smaller, non-significant increases. The effect may be mediated by the known inhibition of cimetidine on hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system probably responsible for the first-pass metabolism of nifedipine. If nifedipine therapy is initiated in patient currently receiving cimetidine, cautious titration is advised.Nifedipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin, an inducer of CYP3A4, lowers the systemic exposure to nifedipine by approximately 70%. Avoid co-administration of nifedipine with phenytoin or any known CYP3A4 inducer or consider an alternative antihypertensive therapy.CYP3A inhibitors such as fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when co-administered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications.. Other Interactions. Grapefruit Juice: Co-administration of nifedipine with grapefruit juice resulted in approximately doubling in nifedipine AUC and max with no change in half-life. The increased plasma concentrations most likely result from inhibition of CYP3A4 related first-pass metabolism. Avoid ingestion of grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided while taking nifedipine. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility. Nifedipine was administered orally to rats for two years and was not shown to be carcinogenic. When given to rats prior to mating, nifedipine caused reduced fertility at dose approximately times the maximum recommended human dose. There is literature report of reversible reduction in the ability of human sperm obtained from limited number of infertile men taking recommended doses of nifedipine to bind to and fertilize an ovum in vitro. In vivo mutagenicity studies were negative. Pregnancy. Pregnancy Category C. Nifedipine has been shown to produce teratogenic findings in rats and rabbits, including digital anomalies similar to those reported for phenytoin. Digital anomalies have been reported to occur with other members of the dihydropyridine class and are possibly result of compromised uterine blood flow. Nifedipine administration was associated with variety of embryotoxic, placentotoxic, and fetotoxic effects, including stunted fetuses (rats, mice, rabbits), rib deformities (mice), cleft palate (mice), small placentas and underdeveloped chorionic villi (monkeys), embryonic and fetal deaths (rats, mice, rabbits), and prolonged pregnancy/decreased neonatal survival (rats; not evaluated in other species). On mg/kg basis, all of the doses associated with the teratogenic embryotoxic or fetotoxic effects in animals were higher (5 to 50 times) than the maximum recommended human dose of 120 mg/day. On mg/m basis, some doses were higher and some were lower than the maximum recommended human dose, but all are within an order of magnitude of it. The doses associated with placentotoxic effects in monkeys were equivalent to or lower than the maximum recommended human dose on mg/m basis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.. Lactation. Nifedipine is transferred through breast milk. Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets should be used during breast-feeding only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. Pediatric Use. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.. Geriatric Use. Age appears to have significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. The clearance is decreased resulting in higher AUC in the elderly. These changes are not due to changes in renal function (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics ).",e65e1547-08ef-6682-e053-2a95a90a51b7,42232-9,PRECAUTIONS SECTION

28664903,"14 CLINICAL STUDIES. All clinical studies supporting the efficacy of levetiracetam utilized oral formulations. The finding of efficacy of levetiracetam injection is based on the results of studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam, and on the demonstration of comparable bioavailability of the oral and parenteral formulations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].. 14.1 Partial-Onset Seizures. Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in AdultsThe effectiveness of levetiracetam for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. The tablet formulation was used in all these studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to placebo, 1,000 mg, 2,000 mg, or 3,000 mg/day. Patients enrolled in Study or Study had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more classical AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least year and had taken one classical AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking stable dose regimen of at least one and could take maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.. Study 1Study was double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 41 sites in the United States comparing levetiracetam 1,000 mg/day (N=97), levetiracetam 3,000 mg/day (N=101), and placebo (N=95) given in equally divided doses twice daily. After prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients were randomized to one of the three treatment groups described above. The 18-week treatment period consisted of 6-week titration period, followed by 12-week fixed dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED regimens were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness was between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate (incidence of patients with >=50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency). The results of the analysis of Study are displayed in Table 10.Table 10: Reduction in Mean Over Placebo in Weekly Frequency of Partial-Onset Seizures in Study 1Placebo (N=95)Levetiracetam 1,000 mg/day (N=97)Levetiracetam 3,000 mg/day (N=101)Percent reduction in partial seizure frequency over placebo-26.1%statistically significant versus placebo 30.1% The percentage of patients (y-axis) who achieved >=50% reduction in weekly seizure rates from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency over the entire randomized treatment period (titration evaluation period) within the three treatment groups (x-axis) is presented in Figure 1.Figure 1: Responder Rate (>=50% Reduction from Baseline) in Study statistically significant versus placebo.

Figure 3. Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Patients Years to 16 Years of AgeStudy was multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in pediatric patients to 16 years of age with partial seizures uncontrolled by standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Study was conducted at 60 sites in North America. The study consisted of an 8-week baseline period and 4-week titration period followed by 10-week evaluation period. Eligible patients who still experienced, on stable dose of 1-2 AEDs, at least partial-onset seizures during the weeks prior to screening, as well as at least partial-onset seizures in each of the two 4-week baseline periods, were randomized to receive either levetiracetam or placebo. Dosing was initiated at dose of 20 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. During the treatment period, levetiracetam doses were adjusted in 20 mg/kg/day increments, at 2-week intervals to the target dose of 60 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of efficacy was between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire 14-week randomized treatment period (titration evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate (incidence of patients with >= 50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency per week). The enrolled population included 198 patients (levetiracetam N=101, placebo N=97) with refractory partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized.Table 13displays the results of Study 4.Table 13: Reduction in Mean Over Placebo in Weekly Frequency of Partial-Onset Seizures in Study 4Placebo (N=97)Levetiracetam (N=101)Percent reduction in partial seizure frequency over placebo-26.8%statistically significant versus placeboThe percentage of patients (y-axis) who achieved >= 50% reduction in weekly seizure rates from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency over the entire randomized treatment period (titration evaluation period) within the two treatment groups (x-axis) is presented inFigure 4.Figure 4: Responder Rate (>= 50% Reduction from Baseline) in Study 4statistically significant versus placebo. Figure 4. Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Patients Month to <4 Years of AgeStudy was multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in pediatric patients month to less than years of age with partial seizures, uncontrolled by standard epileptic drugs (AEDs). Study was conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe. Study consisted of 5-day evaluation period, which included 1-day titration period followed by 4-day maintenance period. Eligible patients who experienced, on stable dose of 1-2 AEDs, at least partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either levetiracetam or placebo. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows: month to less than months of age (N=4 treated with levetiracetam), months to less than year of age (N=8 treated with levetiracetam), year to less than years of age (N=20 treated with levetiracetam), and years to less than years of age (N=28 treated with levetiracetam). Levetiracetam dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children month to less than months old were randomized to target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children months to less than years old were randomized to target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of efficacy was the responder rate (percent of patients with >= 50% reduction from baseline in average daily partial-onset seizure frequency) assessed by blinded central reader using 48-hour video EEG performed during the last two days of the 4-day maintenance period. The enrolled population included 116 patients (levetiracetam N=60, placebo N=56) with refractory partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. total of 109 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. statistically significant difference between levetiracetam and placebo was observed in Study (seeFigure 5). The treatment effect associated with levetiracetam was consistent across age groups.Figure 5: Responder Rate for All Patients Ages Month to 4 Years (>= 50% Reduction from Baseline) in Study 5statistically significant versus placebo. Figure 5. 14.2Myoclonic Seizures in Patients with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy. The effectiveness of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy in patients 12 years of age and older with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) experiencing myoclonic seizures was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (study 6), conducted at 37 sites in 14 countries. Eligible patients on stable dose of antiepileptic drug (AED) experiencing one or more myoclonic seizures per day for at least days during the prospective 8-week baseline period were randomized to either levetiracetam or placebo (levetiracetam N=60, placebo N=60). Patients were titrated over weeks to target dose of 3,000 mg/day and treated at stable dose of 3,000 mg/day over 12 weeks (evaluation period). Study drug was given in divided doses. The primary measure of efficacy was the proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction in the number of days per week with one or more myoclonic seizures during the treatment period (titration evaluation periods) as compared to baseline. Table 14 displays the results for the 113 patients with JME in this study.

The effectiveness of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy in patients years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures was establised in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (study 7), conducted at 50 sites in countries. Eligible patients on stable dose of or antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) experiencing at least PGTC seizures during the 8-week combined baseline period (at least one PGTC seizure during the weeks prior to the prospective baseline period and at least one PGTC seizure during the 4-week prospective baseline period) were randomized to either levetiracetam or placebo. The 8-week combined baseline period is referred to as baseline in the remainder of this section. Patients were titrated over weeks to target dose of 3,000 mg/day for adults or pediatric target dose of 60 mg/kg/day and treated at stable dose of 3,000 mg/day (or 60 mg/kg/day for children) over 20 weeks (evaluation period). Study drug was given in equally divided doses per day. The primary measure of efficacy was the percent reduction from baseline in weekly PGTC seizure frequency for levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups over the treatment period (titration evaluation periods). The population included 164 patients (levetiracetam N=80, placebo N=84) with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (predominately juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy, or epilepsy with Grand Mal seizures on awakening) experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Each of these syndromes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy was well represented in this patient population.There was statistically significant decrease from baseline in PGTC frequency in the levetiracetam-treated patients compared to the placebo-treated patients in Study (seeTable 15).Table 15: Median Percent Reduction from Baseline in PGTC Seizure Frequency per Week in Study 7Placebo (N=84)Levetiracetam (N=78)Percentage reduction in PGTC seizure frequency44.6%77.6%statistically significant versus placeboThe percentage of patients (y-axis) who achieved >=50% reduction in weekly seizure rates from baseline in PGTC seizure frequency over the entire randomized treatment period (titration evaluation period) within the two treatment groups (x-axis) is presented inFigure 6.Figure 6: Responder Rate (>=50% Reduction from Baseline) in PGTC Seizure Frequency per Week in Study statistically significant versus placebo.

Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, drug discontinuation syndrome.

PPHN occurs in to per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Several recent epidemiologic studies suggest positive statistical association between SSRI use (including escitalopram oxalate) in pregnancy and PPHN. Other studies do not show significant statistical association.Physicians should also note the results of prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with history of major depression, who were either on antidepressants or had received antidepressants less than 12 weeks prior to their last menstrual period, and were in remission. Women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy showed significant increase in relapse of their major depression compared to those women who remained on antidepressant medication throughout pregnancy.When treating pregnant woman with escitalopram oxalate, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks of taking an SSRI, along with the established benefits of treating depression with an antidepressant.

28281170,"WARNINGS. Vulnerability to Opioid Overdose. After opioid detoxification, patients are likely to have reduced tolerance to opioids. As the blockade of exogenous opioids provided by naltrexone hydrochloride wanes and eventually dissipates completely, patients who have been treated with naltrexone hydrochloride may respond to lower doses of opioids than previously used, just as they would shortly after completing detoxification. This could result in potentially life-threatening opioid intoxication (respiratory compromise or arrest, circulatory collapse, etc.) if the patient uses previously tolerated doses of opioids. Cases of opioid overdose with fatal outcomes have been reported in patients after discontinuing treatment. Patients should be alerted that they may be more sensitive to opioids, even at lower doses, after naltrexone hydrochloride treatment is discontinued. It is important that patients inform family members, and the people closest to the patient of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose (see PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients). There is also the possibility that patient who is treated with naltrexone hydrochloride could overcome the opioid blockade effect of naltrexone hydrochloride. Although naltrexone hydrochloride is potent antagonist, the blockade produced by naltrexone hydrochloride is surmountable. The plasma concentration of exogenous opioids attained immediately following their acute administration may be sufficient to overcome the competitive receptor blockade. This poses potential risk to individuals who attempt, on their own, to overcome the blockade by administering large amounts of exogenous opioids. Any attempt by patient to overcome the antagonism by taking opioids is especially dangerous and may lead to life-threatening opioid intoxication or fatal overdose. Patients should be told of the serious consequences of trying to overcome the opioid blockade (see PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients). Precipitated Opioid Withdrawal. The symptoms of spontaneous opioid withdrawal (which are associated with the discontinuation of opioid in dependent individual) are uncomfortable, but they are not generally believed to be severe or necessitate hospitalization. However, when withdrawal is precipitated abruptly by the administration of an opioid antagonist to an opioid-dependent patient, the resulting withdrawal syndrome can be severe enough to require hospitalization. Symptoms of withdrawal have usually appeared within five minutes of ingestion of naltrexone hydrochloride and have lasted for up to 48 hours. Mental status changes including confusion, somnolence and visual hallucinations have occurred. Significant fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhea have required intravenous fluid administration. Review of postmarketing cases of precipitated opioid withdrawal in association with naltrexone treatment has identified cases with symptoms of withdrawal severe enough to require hospital admission, and in some cases, management in the intensive care unit. To prevent occurrence of precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids, or exacerbation of preexisting subclinical withdrawal syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting naltrexone hydrochloride treatment. An opioid-free interval of minimum of to 10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as two weeks. If more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed. In every case, healthcare providers should always be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications because there is no completely reliable method for determining whether patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. naloxone challenge test may be helpful; however, few case reports have indicated that patients may experience precipitated withdrawal despite having negative urine toxicology screen or tolerating naloxone challenge test (usually in the setting of transitioning from buprenorphine treatment). Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use. Patients treated for alcohol dependence with naltrexone hydrochloride should also be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids. Hepatotoxicity. Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction were observed in association with naltrexone hydrochloride exposure during the clinical development program and in the postmarketing period. Transient, asymptomatic hepatic transaminase elevations were also observed in the clinical trials and postmarketing period. When patients presented with elevated transaminases, there were often other potential causative or contributory etiologies identified, including preexisting alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis and/or infection, and concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Although clinically significant liver dysfunction is not typically recognized as manifestation of opioid withdrawal, opioid withdrawal that is precipitated abruptly may lead to systemic sequelae, including acute liver injury. Patients should be warned of the risk of hepatic injury and advised to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of acute hepatitis. Use of naltrexone hydrochloride should be discontinued in the event of symptoms and/or signs of acute hepatitis. Depression and Suicidality Depression, suicide, attempted suicide and suicidal ideation have been reported in the postmarketing experience with naltrexone hydrochloride used in the treatment of opioid dependence. No causal relationship has been demonstrated. In the literature, endogenous opioids have been theorized to contribute to variety of conditions. Alcohol-and opioid-dependent patients, including those taking naltrexone hydrochloride, should be monitored for the development of depression or suicidal thinking. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with naltrexone hydrochloride should be alerted to the need to monitor patients for the emergence of symptoms of depression or suicidality, and to report such symptoms to the patients healthcare provider.. Ultra Rapid Opioid Withdrawal:. Safe use of naltrexone hydrochloride in ultra rapid opiate detoxification programs has not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).",f821dd49-3fa7-4d33-99de-19023ff1ae65,34071-1,WARNINGS SECTION

28866902,"12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The Tmax of fingolimod is 12-16 hours. The apparent absolute oral bioavailability is 93%. Food intake does not alter Cmax or (AUC) of fingolimod or fingolimod-phosphate. Therefore, fingolimod capsules may be taken without regard to meals. Steady-state blood concentrations are reached within to months following once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 10-fold greater than with the initial dose. Distribution Fingolimod highly (86%) distributes in red blood cells. Fingolimod-phosphate has smaller uptake in blood cells of 17%. Fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate are 99.7% protein bound. Fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate protein binding is not altered by renal or hepatic impairment. Fingolimod is extensively distributed to body tissues with volume of distribution of about 1200 +- 260 L. Metabolism The biotransformation of fingolimod in humans occurs by main pathways: by reversible stereoselective phosphorylation to the pharmacologically active (S)-enantiomer of fingolimod-phosphate, by oxidative biotransformation catalyzed mainly by the cytochrome P450 4F2 (CYP4F2) and possibly other CYP4F isoenzymes with subsequent fatty acid-like degradation to inactive metabolites, and by formation of pharmacologically inactive non-polar ceramide analogs of fingolimod. Inhibitors or inducers of CYP4F2 and possibly other CYP4F isozymes might alter the exposure of fingolimod or fingolimod-phosphate. In vitro studies in hepatocytes indicated that CYP3A4 may contribute to fingolimod metabolism in the case of strong induction of CYP3A4. Following single oral administration of [14C] fingolimod, the major fingolimod-related components in blood, as judged from their contribution to the AUC up to 816 hours post-dose of total radiolabeled components, are fingolimod itself (23.3%), fingolimod-phosphate (10.3%), and inactive metabolites [M3 carboxylic acid metabolite (8.3%), M29 ceramide metabolite (8.9%), and M30 ceramide metabolite (7.3%)]. Elimination Fingolimod blood clearance is 6.3 +- 2.3 L/h, and the average apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) is to days. Blood levels of fingolimod-phosphate decline in parallel with those of fingolimod in the terminal phase, yielding similar half-lives for both. After oral administration, about 81% of the dose is slowly excreted in the urine as inactive metabolites. Fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate are not excreted intact in urine but are the major components in the feces with amounts of each representing less than 2.5% of the dose. Specific Populations Pediatric PatientsThe median fingolimod-phosphate (fingolimod-P) concentration in pediatric MS patients aged 10 to less than 18 years was 1.10 ng/mL, as compared to 1.35 ng/mL in adult MS patients.Geriatric PatientsThe mechanism for elimination and results from population pharmacokinetics suggest that dose adjustment would not be necessary in elderly patients. However, clinical experience in patients aged above 65 years is limited. GenderGender has no clinically significant influence on fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate pharmacokinetics. RaceThe effects of race on fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate pharmacokinetics cannot be adequately assessed due to low number of non-white patients in the clinical program. Renal ImpairmentIn adult patients with severe renal impairment, fingolimod Cmax and AUC are increased by 32% and 43%, respectively, and fingolimod-phosphate Cmax and AUC are increased by 25% and 14%, respectively, with no change in apparent elimination half-life. Based on these findings, the fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg dose is appropriate for use in adult patients with renal impairment. Fingolimod capsules 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg are appropriate for use in pediatric patients with renal impairment. The systemic exposure of metabolites (M2 and M3) is increased by 3-and 13-fold, respectively. The toxicity of these metabolites has not been fully characterized. study in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment has not been conducted. Hepatic ImpairmentIn subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, B, and C), no change in fingolimod Cmax was observed, but fingolimod AUC0- was increased respectively by 12%, 44%, and 103%. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), fingolimod-phosphate Cmax was decreased by 22% and AUC0-96 hours was decreased by 29%. The pharmacokinetics of fingolimod-phosphate was not evaluated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The apparent elimination half-life of fingolimod is unchanged in subjects with mild hepatic impairment, but is prolonged by about 50% in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) should be closely monitored, as the risk of adverse reactions is greater [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class and B). Drug Interactions KetoconazoleThe coadministration of ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A and CYP4F) 200 mg twice-daily at steady-state and single dose of fingolimod mg led to 70% increase in AUC of fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate. Patients who use fingolimod capsules and systemic ketoconazole concomitantly should be closely monitored, as the risk of adverse reactions is greater [see Drug Interactions 7.2 )]. CarbamazepineThe coadministration of carbamazepine (a potent CYP450 enzyme inducer) 600 mg twice-daily at steady-state and single dose of fingolimod mg decreased blood concentrations (AUC) of fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate by approximately 40%. The clinical impact of this decrease is unknown. Other strong CYP450 enzyme inducers, e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and St. Johns wort, may also reduce AUC of fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate. The clinical impact of this potential decrease is unknown. Potential of Fingolimod and Fingolimod-phosphate to Inhibit the Metabolism of ComedicationsIn vitro inhibition studies using pooled human liver microsomes and specific metabolic probe substrates demonstrate that fingolimod has little or no capacity to inhibit the activity of the following CYP enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5, or CYP4A9/11 (fingolimod only), and similarly fingolimod-phosphate has little or no capacity to inhibit the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4 at concentrations up to orders of magnitude of therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate are unlikely to reduce the clearance of drugs that are mainly cleared through metabolism by the major CYP isoenzymes described above. Potential of Fingolimod and Fingolimod-phosphate to Induce its Own and/or the Metabolism of ComedicationsFingolimod was examined for its potential to induce human CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP4F2, and MDR1 (P-glycoprotein) mRNA and CYP3A, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP4F2 activity in primary human hepatocytes. Fingolimod did not induce mRNA or activity of the different CYP enzymes and MDR1 with respect to the vehicle control; therefore, no clinically relevant induction of the tested CYP enzymes or MDR1 by fingolimod are expected at therapeutic concentrations. Fingolimod-phosphate was also examined for its potential to induce mRNA and/or activity of human CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A, CYP4F2, CYP4F3B, and CYP4F12. Fingolimod-phosphate is not expected to have clinically significant induction effects on these enzymes at therapeutic doses of fingolimod. In vitro experiments did not provide an indication of CYP induction by fingolimod-phosphate. TransportersBased on in vitro data, fingolimod as well as fingolimod-phosphate are not expected to inhibit the uptake of comedications and/or biologics transported by the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or the sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP). Similarly, they are not expected to inhibit the efflux of comedications and/or biologics transported by the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), the bile salt export pump (BSEP), the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP2), or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at therapeutic concentrations. Oral ContraceptivesThe coadministration of fingolimod 0.5 mg daily with oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) did not elicit any clinically significant change in oral contraceptives exposure. Fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate exposure were consistent with those from previous studies. No interaction studies have been performed with oral contraceptives containing other progestagens; however, an effect of fingolimod on their exposure is not expected. CyclosporineThe pharmacokinetics of single-dose fingolimod was not altered during coadministration with cyclosporine at steady-state, nor was cyclosporine steady-state pharmacokinetics altered by fingolimod. These data indicate that fingolimod capsules are unlikely to reduce or increase the clearance of drugs cleared mainly by CYP3A4. Potent inhibition of transporters MDR1 (P-gp), MRP2, and OATP-1B1 does not influence fingolimod disposition. Isoproterenol, Atropine, Atenolol, and DiltiazemSingle-dose fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate exposure was not altered by coadministered isoproterenol or atropine. Likewise, the single-dose pharmacokinetics of fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate and the steady-state pharmacokinetics of both atenolol and diltiazem were unchanged during the coadministration of the latter drugs individually with fingolimod. Population Pharmacokinetics AnalysisA population pharmacokinetics evaluation performed in MS patients did not provide evidence for significant effect of fluoxetine and paroxetine (strong CYP2D6 inhibitors) on fingolimod or fingolimod-phosphate predose concentrations. In addition, the following commonly coprescribed substances had no clinically relevant effect (< 20%) on fingolimod or fingolimod-phosphate predose concentrations: baclofen, gabapentin, oxybutynin, amantadine, modafinil, amitriptyline, pregabalin, and corticosteroids.",6c0faf2b-21fb-4830-bb78-5f2dbceb2c82,43682-4,PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION

In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. DataAnimal DataReproductive studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses of up to 2000 and 500 mg/kg/day, respectively, and in both species at intravenous doses of up to 200 mg/kg/day, and have revealed no significant evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to famotidine tablets. While no direct fetotoxic effects have been observed, sporadic abortions occurring only in mothers displaying marked decreased food intake were seen in some rabbits at oral doses of 200 mg/kg/day (about 49 times the recommended human dose of 80 mg per day, based on body surface area) or higher. There are, however, no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.. 8.2 Lactation. Risk SummaryThere are limited data available on the presence of famotidine in human breast milk. There were no effects on the breastfed infant. There are no data on famotidine effects on milk production. Famotidine is present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mothers clinical need for famotidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from famotidine tabletsor from the underlying maternal condition. DataAnimal DataTransient growth depression was observed in young rats suckling from mothers treated with maternotoxic doses of famotidine at least 600 times the usual human dose.. 8.4 Pediatric Use. The safety and effectiveness of famotidine tablets have been established in pediatric patients for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease (i.e., duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer) and GERD (i.e., symptomatic nonerosive GERD, erosive esophagitis as diagnosed by endoscopy). The use of famotidine tablets and the recommended dosage of famotidine tablets in these pediatric patients is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of famotidine tablets in adults and published pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in pediatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)]. In pediatric patients, the safety and effectiveness for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions and reduction of risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence have not been established. Famotidine tablets 20 and 40 mg tablets are not recommended for use in pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg because these tablet strengths exceed the recommended dose for these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. For pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg, consider another famotidine formulation (e.g., oral suspension, lower dose tablet).. 8.5 Geriatric Use. Of the 1442 famotidine tablets-treated patients in clinical studies, approximately 10% were 65 and older. In these studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In postmarketing experience, CNS adverse reactions have been reported in elderly patients with and without renal impairment receiving famotidine tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Famotidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to famotidine tablets may be greater in elderly patients, particularly those with impaired renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. In general, use the lowest effective dose of famotidine tablets for an elderly patient and monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment. CNS adverse reactions and prolonged QT intervals have been reported in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment [see warnings and precautions (5.1)]. The clearance of famotidine is reduced in adults with moderate and severe renal impairment compared to adults with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/minute). Dosage reduction is recommended in adult and pediatric patients greater than or equal to 40 kg with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].",cd5a5551-4f0e-4466-b696-e6fe1f32b773,43684-0,USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS SECTION
27940914,"Pharmacodynamics. In standard animal or human pharmacological tests, beta-adrenoreceptor blocking activity of atenolol has been demonstrated by: (1) reduction in resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output, (2) reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and on exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction in reflex orthostatic tachycardia.A significant beta-blocking effect of atenolol, as measured by reduction of exercise tachycardia, is apparent within one hour following oral administration of single dose. This effect is maximal at about to hours, and persists for at least 24 hours. Maximum reduction in exercise tachycardia occurs within minutes of an intravenous dose. For both orally and intravenously administered drug, the duration of action is dose related and also bears linear relationship to the logarithm of plasma atenolol concentration. The effect on exercise tachycardia of single 10 mg intravenous dose is largely dissipated by 12 hours, whereas beta-blocking activity of single oral doses of 50 mg and 100 mg is still evident beyond 24 hours following administration. However, as has been shown for all beta-blocking agents, the antihypertensive effect does not appear to be related to plasma level.In normal subjects, the beta1 selectivity of atenolol has been shown by its reduced ability to reverse the beta2-mediated vasodilating effect of isoproterenol as compared to equivalent beta-blocking doses of propranolol. In asthmatic patients, dose of atenolol producing greater effect on resting heart rate than propranolol resulted in much less increase in airway resistance. In placebo controlled comparison of approximately equipotent oral doses of several beta-blockers, atenolol produced significantly smaller decrease of FEV1 than nonselective beta-blockers such as propranolol and, unlike those agents, did not inhibit bronchodilation in response to isoproterenol.Consistent with its negative chronotropic effect due to beta-blockade of the SA node, atenolol increases sinus cycle length and sinus node recovery time. Conduction in the AV node is also prolonged. Atenolol is devoid of membrane stabilizing activity, and increasing the dose well beyond that producing beta-blockade does not further depress myocardial contractility. Several studies have demonstrated moderate (approximately 10%) increase in stroke volume at rest and during exercise.In controlled clinical trials, atenolol, given as single daily oral dose, was an effective antihypertensive agent providing 24-hour reduction of blood pressure. Atenolol has been studied in combination with thiazide-type diuretics, and the blood pressure effects of the combination are approximately additive. Atenolol is also compatible with methyldopa, hydralazine, and prazosin, each combination resulting in larger fall in blood pressure than with the single agents. The dose range of atenolol is narrow and increasing the dose beyond 100 mg once daily is not associated with increased antihypertensive effect. The mechanisms of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents have not been established. Several possible mechanisms have been proposed and include: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output, (2) central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery, and (3) suppression of renin activity. The results from long-term studies have not shown any diminution of the antihypertensive efficacy of atenolol with prolonged use.By blocking the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of catecholamines and by decreasing blood pressure, atenolol generally reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort, making it useful for many patients in the long-term management of angina pectoris. On the other hand, atenolol can increase oxygen requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length and end diastolic pressure, particularly in patients with heart failure.In multicenter clinical trial (ISIS-1) conducted in 16,027 patients with suspected myocardial infarction, patients presenting within 12 hours (mean 5 hours) after the onset of pain were randomized to either conventional therapy plus atenolol (n 8,037), or conventional therapy alone (n 7,990). Patients with heart rate of 50 bpm or systolic blood pressure 100 mm Hg, or with other contraindications to beta-blockade were excluded. Thirty-eight percent of each group were treated within hours of onset of pain. The mean time from onset of pain to entry was +- 2.7 hours in both groups. Patients in the atenolol group were to receive atenolol I.V. injection to 10 mg given over minutes plus atenolol tablets 50 mg every 12 hours orally on the first study day (the first oral dose administered about 15 minutes after the IV dose) followed by either atenolol tablets 100 mg once daily or atenolol tablets 50 mg twice daily on days to 7. The groups were similar in demographic and medical history characteristics and in electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial infarction, bundle branch block, and first degree atrioventricular block at entry.During the treatment period (days to 7), the vascular mortality rates were 3.89% in the atenolol group (313 deaths) and 4.57% in the control group (365 deaths). This absolute difference in rates, 0.68%, is statistically significant at the < 0.05 level. The absolute difference translates into proportional reduction of 15% (3.89 4.57/4.57 -0.15). The 95% confidence limits are 1% to 27%. Most of the difference was attributed to mortality in days to (atenolol 121 deaths; control 171 deaths).Despite the large size of the ISIS-1 trial, it is not possible to identify clearly subgroups of patients most likely or least likely to benefit from early treatment with atenolol. Good clinical judgment suggests, however, that patients who are dependent on sympathetic stimulation for maintenance of adequate cardiac output and blood pressure are not good candidates for beta-blockade. Indeed, the trial protocol reflected that judgment by excluding patients with blood pressure consistently below 100 mm Hg systolic. The overall results of the study are compatible with the possibility that patients with borderline blood pressure (less than 120 mm Hg systolic), especially if over 60 years of age, are less likely to benefit.The mechanism through which atenolol improves survival in patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction is unknown, as is the case for other beta-blockers in the postinfarction setting. Atenolol, in addition to its effects on survival, has shown other clinical benefits including reduced frequency of ventricular premature beats, reduced chest pain, and reduced enzyme elevationAtenolol Geriatric Pharmacology:In general, elderly patients present higher atenolol plasma levels with total clearance values about 50% lower than younger subjects. The half-life is markedly longer in the elderly compared to younger subjects. The reduction in atenolol clearance follows the general trend that the elimination of renally excreted drugs is decreased with increasing age.",87b3326b-7751-4aa5-b9c1-7e72a9daae1f,43681-6,PHARMACODYNAMICS SECTION

EKG changes and cardiac arrhythmias.. Treatment. It is important to determine other medications taken by the patient since multiple drug therapy is common in overdosage situations. Treatment is essentially symptomatic and supportive. Early gastric lavage is helpful. Keep patient under observation and maintain an open airway, since involvement of the extrapyramidal mechanism may produce dysphagia and respiratory difficulty in severe overdosage. Do not attempt to induce emesis because dystonic reaction of the head or neck may develop that could result in aspiration of vomitus. Extrapyramidal symptoms may be treated with anti-parkinsonism drugs, barbiturates, or diphenhydramine hydrochloride. See prescribing information for these products. Care should be taken to avoid increasing respiratory depression. If administration of stimulant is desirable, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, or caffeine with sodium benzoate is recommended. Stimulants that may cause convulsions (e.g., picrotoxin or pentylenetetrazol) should be avoided.If hypotension occurs, the standard measures for managing circulatory shock should be initiated. If it is desirable to administer vasoconstrictor, norepinephrine and phenylephrine are most suitable.

28912832,"13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY. 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility. In two 24-month carcinogenicity studies in rats, omeprazole at daily doses of 1.7, 3.4, 13.8, 44 and 140.8 mg/kg/day (about 0.4 to 34 times human dose of 40 mg/day, as expressed on body surface area basis) produced gastric ECL cell carcinoids in dose-related manner in both male and female rats; the incidence of this effect was markedly higher in female rats, which had higher blood levels of omeprazole. Gastric carcinoids seldom occur in the untreated rat. In addition, ECL cell hyperplasia was present in all treated groups of both sexes. In one of these studies, female rats were treated with 13.8 mg omeprazole/kg/day (about 3.4 times human dose of 40 mg/day, based on body surface area) for one year, and then followed for an additional year without the drug. No carcinoids were seen in these rats. An increased incidence of treatment-related ECL cell hyperplasia was observed at the end of one year (94% treated vs. 10% controls). By the second year the difference between treated and control rats was much smaller (46% vs 26%) but still showed more hyperplasia in the treated group. Gastric adenocarcinoma was seen in one rat (2%). No similar tumor was seen in male or female rats treated for two years. For this strain of rat no similar tumor has been noted historically, but finding involving only one tumor is difficult to interpret. In 52-week toxicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, brain astrocytomas were found in small number of males that received omeprazole at dose levels of 0.4, 2, and 16 mg/kg/day (about 0.1 to 3.9 times the human dose of 40 mg/day, based on body surface area basis). No astrocytomas were observed in female rats in this study. In 2-year carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, no astrocytomas were found in males or females at the high dose of 140.8 mg/kg/day (about 34 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on body surface area basis). 78-week mouse carcinogenicity study of omeprazole did not show increased tumor occurrence, but the study was not conclusive. 26-week p53 (+/-) transgenic mouse carcinogenicity study was not positive. Omeprazole was positive for clastogenic effects in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay, in one of two in vivo mouse micronucleus tests, and in an in vivo bone marrow cell chromosomal aberration assay. Omeprazole was negative in the in vitro Ames test, an in vitro mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, and an in vivo rat liver DNA damage assay. Omeprazole at oral doses up to 138 mg/kg/day in rats (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on body surface area basis) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance.In 24-month carcinogenicity studies in rats, dose-related significant increase in gastric carcinoid tumors and ECL cell hyperplasia was observed in both male and female animals [see Warnings and Precautions 5)] Carcinoid tumors have also been observed in rats subjected to fundectomy or long-term treatment with other proton pump inhibitors or high doses of 2-receptor antagonists.",f76c23d5-26b6-cfb2-e053-6294a90aea42,43680-8,NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY SECTION

28957044,"Dependence. Physical DependenceLorazepam may produce physical dependence from continued therapy. Physical dependence is state that develops as result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or significant dose reduction of drug. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of benzodiazepines or administration of flumazenil, benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening. Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e., higher and/or more frequent doses) and those who have had longer durations of use (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions ). To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use gradual taper to discontinue lorazepam or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Lorazepamand WARNINGS). Acute Withdrawal Signs and SymptomAcute withdrawal signs and symptoms associated with benzodiazepines have included abnormal involuntary movements, anxiety, blurred vision, depersonalization, depression, derealization, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal adverse reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, decreased appetite), headache, hyperacusis, hypertension, irritability, insomnia, memory impairment, muscle pain and stiffness, panic attacks, photophobia, restlessness, tachycardia, and tremor. More severe acute withdrawal signs and symptoms, including life-threatening reactions, have included catatonia, convulsions, delirium tremens, depression, hallucinations, mania, psychosis, seizures and suicidality.Protracted Withdrawal SyndromeProtracted withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines is characterized by anxiety, cognitive impairment, depression, insomnia, formication, motor symptoms (e.g., weakness, tremor, muscle twitches), paresthesia, and tinnitus that persists beyond to weeks after initial benzodiazepine withdrawal. Protracted withdrawal symptoms may last weeks to more than 12 months. As result, there may be difficulty in differentiating withdrawal symptoms from potential reemergence or continuation of symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was being used.ToleranceTolerance to lorazepam may develop from continued therapy. Tolerance is physiological state characterized by reduced response to drug after repeated administration (i.e., higher dose of drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at lower dose). Tolerance to the therapeutic effect of lorazepam may develop; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.",0cd02e52-ead5-4b2a-9708-c7c4be7b7995,34087-7,DEPENDENCE SECTION

Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving protracted course of antimicrobial therapy, and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin administered as indicated. Prescribing Cefazolin for Injection in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.",1dc9de56-e259-4546-a1db-23119a8a088e,34072-9,GENERAL PRECAUTIONS SECTION

28939756,"5.1 Hepatotoxicity. Clinically significant and potentially life-threatening liver injury, including acute liver failure requiring transplant, has been reported in patients treated with teriflunomide tablets in the postmarketing setting. Patients with pre-existing liver disease and patients taking other hepatotoxic drugs may be at increased risk for developing liver injury when taking teriflunomide tablets. Clinically significant liver injury can occur at any time during treatment with teriflunomide tablets.Patients with pre-existing acute or chronic liver disease, or those with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN) before initiating treatment, should not normally be treated with teriflunomide tablets. Teriflunomide tablets is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4)]. In placebo-controlled trials, in adult patients ALT greater than three times the ULN occurred in 61/1045 (5.8%) and 62/1002 (6.2%) of patients receiving teriflunomide tablets mg and 14 mg, respectively, and 38/997 (3.8%) of patients receiving placebo, during the treatment period. These elevations occurred mostly within the first year of treatment. Half of the cases returned to normal without drug discontinuation. In clinical trials, if ALT elevation was greater than three times the ULN on two consecutive tests, teriflunomide tablets were discontinued and patients underwent an accelerated elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Of the patients who underwent discontinuation and accelerated elimination in controlled trials, half returned to normal or near normal values within months.One patient in the controlled trials in adult patients developed ALT 32 times the ULN and jaundice months after initiation of teriflunomide tablets 14 mg treatment. The patient was hospitalized for weeks and recovered after plasmapheresis and cholestyramine accelerated elimination procedure. Teriflunomide tablets-induced liver injury in this patient could not be ruled out.Obtain serum transaminase and bilirubin levels within months before initiation of teriflunomide tablets therapy. Monitor ALT levels at least monthly for six months after starting teriflunomide tablets. Consider additional monitoring when teriflunomide tablets are given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Consider discontinuing teriflunomide tablets if serum transaminase increase (greater than three times the ULN) is confirmed. Monitor serum transaminase and bilirubin on teriflunomide tablets therapy, particularly in patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine. If liver injury is suspected to be teriflunomide tablets-induced, discontinue teriflunomide tablets and start an accelerated elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized. If teriflunomide tablets-induced liver injury is unlikely because some other probable cause has been found, resumption of teriflunomide tablets therapy may be considered.",8219b4a2-fb9d-4387-ba33-96d28aad71dd,42229-5,SPL UNCLASSIFIED SECTION

Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1). Arrhythmias: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.2). Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk (5.3). Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.4). Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.5). Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6). Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue zolmitriptanif occurs (5.7, 7.4). Patients with Phenylketonuria: Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablet contains phenylalanine (5.9). 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without history of CAD. Perform cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan.. 5.2 Arrhythmias. Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure. As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetals variant angina [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events. Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions. 5-HT1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynauds syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses see Contraindications (4) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of migraine attack, causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established.. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache. Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome. Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving new or greater dose of serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ].. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure. Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists including patients without history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of and mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.9 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria. Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 2.5 mg and mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 2.81 and 5.62 mg of phenylalanine, respectively.",97f627f7-29e1-4e42-9789-f3aeb73003a2,43685-7,WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION

28921200,"DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE. Controlled SubstanceHydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets contain hydrocodone, Schedule II controlled substance.AbuseHydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets contain hydrocodone, substance with high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol, can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion see WARNINGS). All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.Drug addiction is cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes physical withdrawal.Drug-seeking behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). Doctor shopping (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in patient with poor pain control.Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.Hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen TabletsHydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets are for oral use only. Hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets pose risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.DependenceBoth tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.Physical dependence is physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after period of regular exposure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or significant dosage reduction of drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.Do not abruptly discontinue hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets in patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets in patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.When discontinuing hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets, gradually taper the dosage using patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for long duration at high doses, ensure that multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, WARNINGS). Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy).",fa1b60b1-4954-1211-e053-6394a90a0a46,42227-9,DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE SECTION

The different dosage forms of naproxen are bioequivalent in terms of extent of absorption (AUC) and peak concentration (C max); however, the products do differ in their pattern of absorption. These differences between naproxen products are related to both the chemical form of naproxen used and its formulation. Even with the observed differences in pattern of absorption, the elimination half-life of naproxen is unchanged across products ranging from 12 to 17 hours. Steady-state levels of naproxen are reached in to days, and the degree of naproxen accumulation is consistent with this half-life. This suggests that the differences in pattern of release play only negligible role in the attainment of steady-state plasma levels.",35b8ec82-725f-5925-e054-00144ff8d46c,43682-4,PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION

28554945,"Major Depressive Disorder- Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults.The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of major depressive episode was established in six to eight week controlled trials of adult outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-III category of major depressive disorder (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).A major depressive episode implies prominent and relatively persistent depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning (nearly every day for at least weeks); it should include at least of the following symptoms: change in appetite, change in sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, and suicide attempt or suicidal ideation.The antidepressant action of sertraline hydrochloride in hospitalized depressed patients has not been adequately studied.The efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 44 weeks following weeks of open-label acute treatment (52 weeks total) was demonstrated in placebo-controlled trial. The usefulness of the drug in patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should be reevaluated periodically (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder- Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of obsessions and compulsions in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as defined in the DSM-III-R; i.e., the obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time-consuming, or significantly interfere with social or occupational functioning.The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride was established in 12-week trials with obsessive-compulsive outpatients having diagnoses of obsessive-compulsive disorder as defined according to DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses, or images (obsessions) that are ego-dystonic and/or repetitive, purposeful, and intentional behaviors (compulsions) that are recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable.The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining response, in patients with OCD who responded during 52-week treatment phase while taking Sertraline hydrochloride and were then observed for relapse during period of up to 28 weeks, was demonstrated in placebo-controlled trial (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).Panic Disorder- Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder in adults, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-IV. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or significant change in behavior related to the attacks.The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride was established in three 10-12 week trials in adult panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-III-R category of panic disorder (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).Panic disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes.The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining response, in adult patients with panic disorder who responded during 52-week treatment phase while taking Sertraline hydrochloride and were then observed for relapse during period of up to 28 weeks, was demonstrated in placebo-controlled trial (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)- Sertraline hydrochloride (sertraline hydrochloride) is indicated for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder in adults.The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of PTSD was established in two 12-week placebo-controlled trials of adult outpatients whose diagnosis met criteria for the DSM-III-R category of PTSD (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).PTSD, as defined by DSM-III-R/IV, requires exposure to traumatic event that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or threat to the physical integrity of self or others, and response which involves intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Symptoms that occur as result of exposure to the traumatic event include reexperiencing of the event in the form of intrusive thoughts, flashbacks or dreams, and intense psychological distress and physiological reactivity on exposure to cues to the event; avoidance of situations reminiscent of the traumatic event, inability to recall details of the event, and/or numbing of general responsiveness manifested as diminished interest in significant activities, estrangement from others, restricted range of affect, or sense of foreshortened future; and symptoms of autonomic arousal including hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, and irritability or outbursts of anger. PTSD diagnosis requires that the symptoms are present for at least month and that they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining response in adult patients with PTSD for up to 28 weeks following 24 weeks of open-label treatment was demonstrated in placebo-controlled trial. Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in adults.The efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of PMDD was established in placebo-controlled trials of female adult outpatients treated for menstrual cycles who met criteria for the DSM-IIIR/IV category of PMDD (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).The essential features of PMDD include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, affective lability, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. These symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within few days following onset of menses; the disturbance markedly interferes with work or school or with usual social activities and relationships with others. In making the diagnosis, care should be taken to rule out other cyclical mood disorders that may be exacerbated by treatment with an antidepressant.The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride in long-term use, that is, for more than menstrual cycles, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).Social Anxiety Disorder Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia in adults.The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of social anxiety disorder was established in two placebo-controlled trials of adult outpatients with diagnosis of social anxiety disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).Social anxiety disorder, as defined by DSM-IV, is characterized by marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations involving exposure to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others and by fears of acting in humiliating or embarrassing way. Exposure to the feared social situation almost always provokes anxiety and feared social or performance situations are avoided or else are endured with intense anxiety or distress. In addition, patients recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable and the avoidance and anticipatory anxiety of the feared situation is associated with functional impairment or marked distress.The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining response in adult patients with social anxiety disorder for up to 24 weeks following 20 weeks of Sertraline hydrochloride treatment was demonstrated in placebo-controlled trial. Physicians who prescribe Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).",4a62cc04-7073-549c-e054-00144ff8d46c,34067-9,INDICATIONS & USAGE SECTION

Plasma clearance is reduced and elimination half-life is prolonged in pediatric patients to months of age compared to older pediatric patients. The pharmacokinetic parameters for pediatric patients, ages >3 months-15 years, are comparable to those obtained for adults. Bioavailability studies of pediatric patients (11 to 15 years of age) showed mean oral bioavailability of 0.5 compared to adult values of 0.42 to 0.49. Oral doses of 0.5 mg/kg achieved AUCs of 645 +- 249 ng-hr/mL and 580 +- 60 ng-hr/mL in pediatric patients <1 year of age (N=5) and in pediatric patients 11 to 15 years of age, respectively, compared to 482 +- 181 ng-hr/mL in adults treated with 40 mg orally. Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of famotidine were evaluated in pediatric patients to 13 years of age using the sigmoid Emax model. These data suggest that the relationship between serum concentration of famotidine and gastric acid suppression is similar to that observed in one study of adults (Table 7). Table Pharmacodynamics of famotidine using the sigmoid EmaxmodelPediatric Patients EC50 (ng/mL) 26 +- 13 Data from one study a) healthy adult subjects 26.5 +- 10.3 b) adult patients with upper GI bleeding 18.7 +- 10.8 Serum concentration of famotidine associated with 50% maximum gastric acid reduction.

The duration of effect of famotidine I.V. 0.5 mg/kg on gastric pH and acid suppression was shown in one study to be longer in pediatric patients <1 month of age than in older pediatric patients. This longer duration of gastric acid suppression is consistent with the decreased clearance in pediatric patients <3 months of age (see Table 6).",7c0f3fa5-0a44-4a98-bc43-8bff8e95c462,34092-7,CLINICAL STUDIES SECTION

There are limited data from randomized clinical trials in women maintained on buprenorphine that were not designed appropriately to assess the risk of major malformations [see Data]. Observational studies have reported on congenital malformations among buprenorphine-exposed pregnancies, but were also not designed appropriately to assess the risk of congenital malformations specifically due to buprenorphine exposure [see Data]. The extremely limited data on sublingual naloxone exposure in pregnancy are not sufficient to evaluate drug-associated risk. Reproductive and developmental studies in rats and rabbits identified adverse events at clinically relevant and higher doses. Embryo-fetal death was observed in both rats and rabbits administered buprenorphine during the period of organogenesis at doses approximately and 0.3 times, respectively, the human sublingual dose of 16 mg/day of buprenorphine. Pre- and post-natal development studies in rats demonstrated increased neonatal deaths at 0.3 times and above and dystocia at approximately times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg/day of buprenorphine. No clear teratogenic effects were seen when buprenorphine was administered during organogenesis with range of doses equivalent to or greater than the human sublingual dose of 16 mg/day of buprenorphine. However, increases in skeletal abnormalities were noted in rats and rabbits administered buprenorphine daily during organogenesis at doses approximately 0.6 times and approximately equal to the human sublingual dose of 16 mg/day of buprenorphine, respectively. In few studies, some events such as acephalus and omphalocele were also observed but these findings were not clearly treatment-related [see Data]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to fetus. The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. All pregnancies have background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-associated maternal and embryo-fetal riskUntreated opioid addiction in pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes such as low birth weight, preterm birth, and fetal death. In addition, untreated opioid addiction often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use. Dose Adjustment during Pregnancy and the Postpartum PeriodDosage adjustments of buprenorphine may be required during pregnancy, even if the patient was maintained on stable dose prior to pregnancy. Withdrawal signs and symptoms should be monitored closely and the dose adjusted as necessary.Fetal/neonatal adverse reactionsNeonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome may occur in newborn infants of mothers who are receiving treatment with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or failure to gain weight. Signs of neonatal withdrawal usually occur in the first days after birth. The duration and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome may vary. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Labor or DeliveryOpioid-dependent women on buprenorphine maintenance therapy may require additional analgesia during labor. DataHuman DataStudies have been conducted to evaluate neonatal outcomes in women exposed to buprenorphine during pregnancy. Limited data from trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports on buprenorphine use in pregnancy do not indicate an increased risk of major malformations specifically due to buprenorphine. Several factors may complicate the interpretation of investigations of the children of women who take buprenorphine during pregnancy, including maternal use of illicit drugs, late presentation for prenatal care, infection, poor compliance, poor nutrition, and psychosocial circumstances. Interpretation of data is complicated further by the lack of information on untreated opioid-dependent pregnant women, who would be the most appropriate group for comparison. Rather, women on another form of opioid medication-assisted treatment, or women in the general population are generally used as the comparison group. However, women in these comparison groups may be different from women prescribed buprenorphine-containing products with respect to maternal factors that may lead to poor pregnancy outcomes.In multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial [Maternal Opioid Treatment: Human Experimental Research (MOTHER)] designed primarily to assess neonatal opioid withdrawal effects, opioid-dependent pregnant women were randomized to buprenorphine (n=86) or methadone (n=89) treatment, with enrollment at an average gestational age of 18.7 weeks in both groups. total of 28 of the 86 women in the buprenorphine group (33%) and 16 of the 89 women in the methadone group (18%) discontinued treatment before the end of pregnancy.Among women who remained in treatment until delivery, there was no difference between buprenorphine-treated and methadone-treated groups in the number of neonates requiring NOWS treatment or in the peak severity of NOWS. Buprenorphine-exposed neonates required less morphine (mean total dose, 1.1 mg vs. 10.4 mg), had shorter hospital stays (10 days vs. 17.5 days), and shorter duration of treatment for NOWS (4.1 days vs. 9.9 days) compared to the methadone-exposed group. There were no differences between groups in other primary outcomes (neonatal head circumference,) or secondary outcomes (weight and length at birth, preterm birth, gestational age at delivery, and 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores), or in the rates of maternal or neonatal adverse events. The outcomes among mothers who discontinued treatment before delivery and may have relapsed to illicit opioid use are not known. Because of the imbalance in discontinuation rates between the buprenorphine and methadone groups, the study findings are difficult to interpret.Animal Data The exposure margins listed below are based on body surface area comparisons (mg/m 2) to the human sublingual dose of 16 mg buprenorphine via Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets. Effects on embryo-fetal development were studied in Sprague-Dawley rats and Russian white rabbits following oral (1:1) and intramuscular (IM) (3:2) administration of mixtures of buprenorphine and naloxone during the period of organogenesis. Following oral administration to rats no teratogenic effects were observed at buprenorphine doses up to 250 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure approximately 150 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg) in the presence of maternal toxicity (mortality). Following oral administration to rabbits, no teratogenic effects were observed at buprenorphine doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure approximately 50 times, the human sublingual dose of 16 mg) in the absence of clear maternal toxicity. No definitive drug-related teratogenic effects were observed in rats and rabbits at IM doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure approximately 20 times and 35 times, respectively, the human sublingual dose of 16 mg). Maternal toxicity resulting in mortality was noted in these studies in both rats and rabbits. Acephalus was observed in one rabbit fetus from the low-dose group and omphalocele was observed in two rabbit fetuses from the same litter in the mid-dose group; no findings were observed in fetuses from the high-dose group. Maternal toxicity was seen in the high-dose group but not at the lower doses where the findings were observed. Following oral administration of buprenorphine to rats, dose-related post-implantation losses, evidenced by increases in the numbers of early resorptions with consequent reductions in the numbers of fetuses, were observed at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure approximately times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg). In the rabbit, increased post-implantation losses occurred at an oral dose of 40 mg/kg/day. Following IM administration in the rat and the rabbit, post-implantation losses, as evidenced by decreases in live fetuses and increases in resorptions, occurred at 30 mg/kg/day. Buprenorphine was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits after IM or subcutaneous (SC) doses up to mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately and times, respectively, the human sublingual dose of 16 mg), after IV doses up to 0.8 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 0.5 times and equal to, respectively, the human sublingual dose of 16 mg), or after oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day in rats (estimated exposure was approximately 95 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg) and 25 mg/kg/day in rabbits (estimated exposure was approximately 30 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg). Significant increases in skeletal abnormalities (e.g., extra thoracic vertebra or thoraco-lumbar ribs) were noted in rats after SC administration of mg/kg/day and up (estimated exposure was approximately 0.6 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg), but were not observed at oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day. Increases in skeletal abnormalities in rabbits after IM administration of mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg) in the absence of maternal toxicity or oral administration of mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure was approximately equal to the human sublingual dose of 16 mg) were not statistically significant. In rabbits, buprenorphine produced statistically significant pre-implantation losses at oral doses of mg/kg/day or greater and post-implantation losses that were statistically significant at IV doses of 0.2 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure approximately 0.3 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg). No maternal toxicity was noted at doses causing post-implantation loss in this study.Dystocia was noted in pregnant rats treated intramuscularly with buprenorphine from Gestation Day 14 through Lactation Day 21 at mg/kg/day (approximately times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg). Fertility, and pre- and post-natal development studies with buprenorphine in rats indicated increases in neonatal mortality after oral doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.5 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg), after IM doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.3 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg), and after SC doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.06 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg). An apparent lack of milk production during these studies likely contributed to the decreased pup viability and lactation indices. Delays in the occurrence of righting reflex and startle response were noted in rat pups at an oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 50 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg). 8.2 Lactation. Risk SummaryBased on two studies in 13 lactating women maintained on buprenorphine treatment, buprenorphine and its metabolite norbuprenorphine were present in low levels in human milk and available data have not shown adverse reactions in breastfed infants. There are no data on the combination product buprenorphine/naloxone in breastfeeding, however oral absorption of naloxone is limited. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mothers clinical need for buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.Clinical ConsiderationsAdvise breastfeeding women taking buprenorphine products to monitor the infant for increased drowsiness and breathing difficulties.DataData were consistent from two studies (N=13) of breastfeeding infants whose mothers were maintained on sublingual doses of buprenorphine ranging from 2.4 mg/day to 24 mg/day, showing that the infants were exposed to less than 1% of the maternal daily dose.In study of six lactating women who were taking median sublingual buprenorphine dose of 0.29 mg/kg/day to days after delivery, breast milk provided median infant dose of 0.42 mcg/kg/day of buprenorphine and 0.33 mcg/kg/day of norbuprenorphine, equal to 0.2% and 0.12%, respectively, of the maternal weight-adjusted dose (relative dose/kg (%) of norbuprenorphine was calculated from the assumption that buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine are equipotent).Data from study of seven lactating women who were taking median sublingual buprenorphine dose of mg/day an average of 1.12 months after delivery indicated that the mean milk concentrations (C avg) of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were 3.65 mcg/L and 1.94 mcg/L respectively. Based on the study data, and assuming milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an estimated mean absolute infant dose (AID) of 0.55 mcg/kg/day of buprenorphine and 0.29 mcg/kg/day of norbuprenorphine, or mean relative infant dose (RID) of 0.38% and 0.18%, respectively, of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets have not been established in pediatric patients. This product is not appropriate for the treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome in neonates, because it contains naloxone, an opioid antagonist.. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film, or buprenorphine sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Due to possible decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in geriatric patients, the decision to prescribe buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets should be made cautiously in individuals 65 years of age or older and these patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone has been evaluated in pharmacokinetic study. Both drugs are extensively metabolized in the liver. While no clinically significant changes have been observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment; the plasma levels have been shown to be higher and half-life values have been shown to be longer for both buprenorphine and naloxone in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. The magnitude of the effects on naloxone are greater than that on buprenorphine in both moderately and severely impaired subjects. The difference in magnitude of the effects on naloxone and buprenorphine are greater in subjects with severe hepatic impairment than in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, and therefore the clinical impact of these effects is likely to be greater in patients with severe hepatic impairment than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Buprenorphine/naloxone products should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No differences in buprenorphine pharmacokinetics were observed between dialysis-dependent and normal patients following IV administration of 0.3 mg buprenorphine. The effects of renal failure on naloxone pharmacokinetics are unknown.",b955054b-b37d-4079-4fed-5939b763ecb4,43684-0,USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS SECTION
27954111,"Pregnancy Category C. reproduction study in New Zealand White rabbits demonstrated that levalbuterol HCl was not teratogenic when administered orally at doses up to 25 mg/kg (approximately 110 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose of levalbuterol HCl for adults on mg/m2 basis). However, racemic albuterol sulfate has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and rabbits. study in CD-1 mice given racemic albuterol sulfate subcutaneously showed cleft palate formation in of 111 (4.5%) fetuses at 0.25 mg/kg (less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose of levalbuterol HCl for adults on mg/m2 basis) and in 10 of 108 (9.3%) fetuses at 2.5 mg/kg (approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose of levalbuterol HCl for adults on mg/m2 basis). The drug did not induce cleft palate formation when administered subcutaneously at dose of 0.025 mg/kg (less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose of levalbuterol HCl for adults on mg/m2 basis). Cleft palate also occurred in 22 of 72 (30.5%) fetuses from females treated subcutaneously with 2.5 mg/kg of isoproterenol (positive control).A reproduction study in Stride Dutch rabbits revealed cranioschisis in of 19 (37%) fetuses when racemic albuterol sulfate was administered orally at dose of 50 mg/kg (approximately 110 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose of levalbuterol HCl for adults on mg/m2 basis).A study in which pregnant rats were dosed with radiolabeled racemic albuterol sulfate demonstrated that drug-related material is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus.There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Levalbuterol HCl Inhalation Solution in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Levalbuterol HCl Inhalation Solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.During marketing experience of racemic albuterol, various congenital anomalies, including cleft palate and limb defects, have been rarely reported in the offspring of patients being treated with racemic albuterol.

28395464,"12.4Microbiology. Mechanism of ActionThe bactericidal action of moxifloxacin results from inhibition of the topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination.. ResistanceThe mechanism of action for fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, is different from that of macrolides, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, or tetracyclines; therefore, microorganisms resistant to these classes of drugs may be susceptible to moxifloxacin. Resistance to fluoroquinolones occurs primarily by mutation in topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) or topoisomerase IV genes, decreased outer membrane permeability or drug efflux. In vitro resistance to moxifloxacin develops slowly via multiple-step mutations. Resistance to moxifloxacin occurs in vitro at general frequency of between 1.8 10 -9 to 1 10 -11 for Gram-positive bacteria. Cross ResistanceCross-resistance has been observed between moxifloxacin and other fluoroquinolones against Gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria resistant to other fluoroquinolones may, however, still be susceptible to moxifloxacin. There is no known cross-resistance between moxifloxacin and other classes of antimicrobials.Antimicrobial ActivityMoxifloxacin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].

28420774,"PRECAUTIONS. General:. Worsening of Seizures:When used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, clonazepam may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal). This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and clonazepam may produce absence status.. Loss of Effect:In some studies, up to 30% of patients who initially responded have shown loss of anticonvulsant activity, often within months of administration. In some cases, dosage adjustment may reestablish efficacy.. Laboratory Testing During Long-Term Therapy:Periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during long-term therapy with clonazepam.. Psychiatric and Paradoxical Reactions:Paradoxical reactions, such as agitation, irritability, aggression, anxiety, anger, nightmares, hallucinations, and psychoses are known to occur when using benzodiazepines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric). Should this occur, the use of the drug should be discontinued gradually (see PRECAUTIONS: Risks of Abrupt Withdrawal and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Physical and Psychological Dependence). Paradoxical reactions are more likely to occur in children and in the elderly. Risks of Abrupt Withdrawal:The abrupt withdrawal of clonazepam, particularly in those patients on long-term, high-dose therapy, may precipitate status epilepticus. Therefore, when discontinuing clonazepam, gradual withdrawal is essential. While clonazepam is being gradually withdrawn, the simultaneous substitution of another anticonvulsant may be indicated. Caution in Renally Impaired Patients:Metabolites of clonazepam are excreted by the kidneys; to avoid their excess accumulation, caution should be exercised in the administration of the drug to patients with impaired renal function.. Hypersalivation:Clonazepam may produce an increase in salivation. This should be considered before giving the drug to patients who have difficulty handling secretions. Respiratory Depression: Clonazepam may cause respiratory depression and should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea).Porphyria: Clonazepam may have porphyrogenic effect and should be used with care in patients with porphyria. Information for Patients:A Clonazepam Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time clonazepam is dispensed, as required by law. Patients should be instructed to take clonazepam only as prescribed. Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe clonazepam:. Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids: Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if clonazepam is used with opioids and not to use such drugs concomitantly unless supervised by health care provider (see WARNINGS: Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). Dose Changes:To assure the safe and effective use of benzodiazepines, patients should be informed that, since benzodiazepines may produce psychological and physical dependence, it is advisable that they consult with their physician before either increasing the dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug.. Interference With Cognitive and Motor Performance:Because benzodiazepines have the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clonazepam therapy does not affect them adversely.. Suicidal Thinking and Behavior:Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including clonazepam, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.. Pregnancy:Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with clonazepam (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy). Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll free number 1-888-233-2334 (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy). Nursing:Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy.. Concomitant Medication:Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is potential for interactions.. Alcohol:Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking clonazepam.. Drug Interactions:. Effect of Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines and Opioids: The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites, and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation. Effect of Clonazepam on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs:Clonazepam does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine or phenobarbital. Clonazepam has the potential to influence concentrations of phenytoin. Monitoring of phenytoin concentration is recommended when clonazepam is co-administrated with phenytoin. The effect of clonazepam on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.. Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Clonazepam:Literature reports suggest that ranitidine, an agent that decreases stomach acidity, does not greatly alter clonazepam pharmacokinetics.In study in which the mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the max of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to when it was given alone. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors sertraline (weak CYP3A4 inducer) and fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), and the anti-epileptic drug felbamate (CYP2C19 inhibitor and CYP3A4 inducer) do not affect the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam. Cytochrome P450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital induce clonazepam metabolism, causing an approximately 38% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels. Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral antifungal agents (e.g., fluconazole), should be used cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam because they may impair the metabolism of clonazepam leading to exaggerated concentrations and effects.. Pharmacodynamic Interactions:The CNS-depressant action of the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be potentiated by alcohol, narcotics, barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, antianxiety agents, the phenothiazines, thioxanthene and butyrophenone classes of antipsychotic agents, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants, and by other anticonvulsant drugs.. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:CarcinogenesisCarcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with clonazepam.MutagenesisThe data currently available are not sufficient to determine the genotoxic potential of clonazepam.Impairment of FertilityIn two-generation fertility study in which clonazepam was given orally to rats at 10 and 100 mg/kg/day, there was decrease in the number of pregnancies and in the number of offspring surviving until weaning. The lowest dose tested is approximately and 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on body surface area (mg/m 2) basis. Pregnancy:. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of clonazepam in pregnant women. Available human data on the risk of teratogenicity are inconclusive. There is insufficient evidence in humans to assess the effect of benzodiazepine exposure during pregnancy on neurodevelopment. Administration of benzodiazepines immediately prior to or during childbirth can result in syndrome of hypothermia, hypotonia, respiratory depression, and difficulty feeding. In addition, infants born to mothers who have taken benzodiazepines during the later stages of pregnancy can develop dependence, and subsequently withdrawal, during the postnatal period.In three studies in which clonazepam was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses of 0.2, 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis, similar pattern of malformations (cleft palate, open eyelid, fused sternebrae and limb defects) was observed at all doses, in low, non-dose-related incidence. The lowest dose tested is less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and similar to the MRHD of mg/day for panic disorder, on mg/m basis. Reductions in maternal weight gain occurred at doses of mg/kg/day or greater and reduction in embryofetal growth occurred in one study at dose of 10 mg/kg/day. No adverse maternal or embryofetal effects were observed in mice or rats following oral administration of clonazepam during organogenesis of doses up to 15 or 40 mg/kg/day, respectively (4 and 20 times the MRHD of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 20 and 100 times the MRHD of mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on mg/m basis). Data for other benzodiazepines suggest the possibility of adverse developmental effects (long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function) in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepinesTo provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to clonazepam, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking clonazepam enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on this registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Labor and Delivery:The effect of clonazepam on labor and delivery in humans has not been specifically studied; however, perinatal complications have been reported in children born to mothers who have been receiving benzodiazepines late in pregnancy, including findings suggestive of either excess benzodiazepine exposure or of withdrawal phenomena (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy). Nursing Mothers:The effects of clonazepam on the breastfed infant and on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mothers clinical need for clonazepam and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from clonazepam or from the underlying maternal condition.. Pediatric Use:Because of the possibility that adverse effects on physical or mental development could become apparent only after many years, benefit-risk consideration of the long-term use of clonazepam is important in pediatric patients being treated for seizure disorder (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with panic disorder below the age of 18 have not been established.. Geriatric Use:Clinical studies of clonazepam did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.Because clonazepam undergoes hepatic metabolism, it is possible that liver disease will impair clonazepam elimination. Metabolites of clonazepam are excreted by the kidneys; to avoid their excess accumulation, caution should be exercised in the administration of the drug to patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic and/or renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to assess hepatic and/or renal function at the time of dose selection.Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of clonazepam and observed closely.",748d5647-e1d1-40ee-b52d-14dcf4bceae6,42232-9,PRECAUTIONS SECTION

In adults with postherpetic neuralgia, gabapentin oral solution may be initiated on Day as single 300 mg dose, on Day as 600 mg/day (300 mg two times day), and on Day as 900 mg/day (300 mg three times day). The dose can subsequently be titrated up as needed for pain relief to dose of 1800 mg/day (600 mg three times day). In clinical studies, efficacy was demonstrated over range of doses from 1800 mg/day to 3600 mg/day with comparable effects across the dose range; however, in these clinical studies, the additional benefit of using doses greater than 1800 mg/day was not demonstrated.. 2.2Dosage for Epilepsy with Partial Onset Seizures. Patients 12 years of age and aboveThe starting dose is 300 mg three times day. The recommended maintenance dose of gabapentin is 300 mg to 600 mg three times day. Dosages up to 2400 mg/day have been well tolerated in long-term clinical studies. Doses of 3600 mg/day have also been administered to small number of patients for relatively short duration, and have been well tolerated. Administer gabapentin oral solution three times day. The maximum time between doses should not exceed 12 hours. Pediatric Patients Age to 11 yearsThe starting dose range is 10 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses, and the recommended maintenance dose reached by upward titration over period of approximately days. The recommended maintenance dose of gabapentin in patients to years of age is 40 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. The recommended maintenance dose of gabapentin in patients to 11 years of age is 25 mg/kg/day to 35 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. Gabapentin may be administered as the oral solution, capsule, or tablet, or using combinations of these formulations. Dosages up to 50 mg/kg/day have been well tolerated in long-term clinical study. The maximum time interval between doses should not exceed 12 hours. 2.3Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Renal Impairment. Dosage adjustment in patients 12 years of age and older with renal impairment or undergoing hemodialysis is recommended, as follows (see dosing recommendations above for effective doses in each indication):TABLE 1. Gabapentin Dosage Based on Renal FunctionTID Three times day; BID Two times day; QD Single daily dose For patients with creatinine clearance <15 mL/min, reduce daily dose in proportion to creatinine clearance (e.g., patients with creatinine clearance of 7.5 mL/min should receive one-half the daily dose that patients with creatinine clearance of 15 mL/min receive). Patients on hemodialysis should receive maintenance doses based on estimates of creatinine clearance as indicated in the upper portion of the table and supplemental post-hemodialysis dose administered after each hours of hemodialysis as indicated in the lower portion of the table.

In patients with stable renal function, creatinine clearance can be reasonably well estimated using the equation of Cockcroft and Gault:The use of gabapentin in patients less than 12 years of age with compromised renal function has not been studied.. Equation. 2.4Dosage in Elderly. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and dose should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance values in these patients.. 2.5Administration Information. Administer gabapentin oral solution with or without food. If the gabapentin oral solution dose is reduced, discontinued, or substituted with an alternative medication, this should be done gradually over minimum of week (a longer period may be needed at the discretion of the prescriber).",bfee67dc-d2b1-4a00-92d9-a42be3189c74,34068-7,DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION SECTION

28240860,"8.5 Geriatric Use. In patients with schizophrenia, there was no indication of any different tolerability of olanzapine in the elderly compared to younger patients. Studies in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis have suggested that there may be different tolerability profile in this population compared to younger patients with schizophrenia. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with olanzapine are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. In placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, there was higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. In placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis (n=1184), the following adverse reactions were reported in olanzapine-treated patients at an incidence of at least 2% and significantly greater than placebo-treated patients: falls, somnolence, peripheral edema, abnormal gait, urinary incontinence, lethargy, increased weight, asthenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, dry mouth and visual hallucinations. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was greater with olanzapine than placebo (13% vs 7%). Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with olanzapine are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.

28901160,"INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1) Cholestyramine for Oral Suspension, USP Light powder is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the reduction of elevated serum cholesterol in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (elevated low density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol) who do not respond adequately to diet. Cholestyramine for Oral Suspension, USP Light powder may be useful to lower LDL cholesterol in patients who also have hypertriglyceridemia, but it is not indicated where hypertriglyceridemia is the abnormality of most concern.Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be component of multiple risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Treatment should begin and continue with dietary therapy specific for the type of hyperlipoproteinemia determined prior to initiation of drug therapy. Excess body weight may be an important factor and caloric restriction for weight normalization should be addressed prior to drug therapy in the overweight.Prior to initiating therapy with cholestyramine resin, secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease, other drug therapy, alcoholism), should be excluded and lipid profile performed to assess Total cholesterol, HDL-C and triglycerides (TG). For individuals with TG less than 400 mg/dL (<4.5 mmol/L), LDL-C can be estimated using the following equation:LDL-C Total cholesterol [(TG/5) HDL-C]For TG levels 400 mg/dL, this equation is less accurate and LDL-C concentrations should be determined by ultracentrifugation. In hypertriglyceridemic patients, LDL-C may be low or normal despite elevated Total-C. In such cases cholestyramine resin may not be indicated.Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels should be determined periodically based on NCEP guidelines to confirm initial and adequate long-term response. favorable trend in cholesterol reduction should occur during the first month of cholestyramine resin therapy. The therapy should be continued to sustain cholesterol reduction. If adequate cholesterol reduction is not attained, increasing the dosage of cholestyramine resin or adding other lipid-lowering agents in combination with cholestyramine resin should be considered.Since the goal of treatment is to lower LDL-C, the NCEP4 recommends that LDL-C levels be used to initiate and assess treatment response. If LDL-C levels are not available then Total-C alone may be used to monitor long-term therapy. lipoprotein analysis (including LDL-C determination) should be carried out once year. The NCEP treatment guidelines are summarized below.Definite Atherosclerotic Disease Two or More Other Risk Factors+ LDL-Cholesterol mg/dL (mmol/L)Initiation LevelGoalNoNo>= 190 (4.9)>= 60 (4.1)NoYes>= 160 (4.1)>= 130 (3.4)YesYes or No>= 130 (3.4)>= 100 (-2.6)Coronary heart disease or peripheral vascular disease (including symptomatic carotid artery disease). +Other risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) include: age (males 45 years; females: 55 years or premature menopause without estrogen replacement therapy); family history of premature CHD; current cigarette smoking; hypertension; confirmed HDL-C <35 mg/dL (<0.91 mmol/L); and diabetes mellitus.

28737405,"DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE. Controlled SubstanceAcetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets contain codeine. Codeine in combination with acetaminophen, is Schedule III controlled substance. AbuseAcetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets contain codeine, substance with high potential for abuse similar to other opioids, including fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets can be abused and are subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion (see WARNINGS). All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful, or potentially harmful, consequences, higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes physical withdrawal. Drug-seeking behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care providers. Doctor shopping (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risks Specific to Abuse of Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Tablets Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets are for oral use only. Abuse of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets poses risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. DependenceBoth tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects. Physical dependence is physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after period of regular exposure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or significant dosage reduction of drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage. Do not abruptly discontinue acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets in patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets in patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. When discontinuing acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets, gradually taper the dosage using patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for long duration at high doses, ensure that multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, WARNINGS). Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs (see PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy).",a35b4ba3-43c0-73c8-e053-2a95a90af5b5,42227-9,DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE SECTION

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.",7b29542f-3a32-4113-bb1c-1fbd280046e2,34082-8,GERIATRIC USE SECTION
28136216,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS. 7.1 Fluvoxamine. Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.2 Ciprofloxacin. Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin. Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with mg dose and increased in 2-4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.4 Oral Contraceptives. Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with single mg dose and increase in 2-4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.5 Alcohol. Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.6 Other CNS Depressants. The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.7 a2-adrenergic agonists. Because hypotensive effects may be cumulative, it is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other 2-adrenergic agonists.

Patients should be advised to adhere to their National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)-recommended diet, regular exercise program, and periodic testing of fasting lipid panel. Patients should be advised about substances they should not take concomitantly with simvastatin [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Patients should also be advised to inform other healthcare professionals prescribing new medication or increasing the dose of an existing medication that they are taking simvastatin tablets. 17.1 Muscle Pain. All patients starting therapy with simvastatin tablets should be advised of the risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis, and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if these muscle signs or symptoms persist after discontinuing simvastatin. Patients using the 80-mg dose should be informed that the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, is increased with use of the 80-mg dose. The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, occurring with use of simvastatin tablets are increased when taking certain types of medication or consuming larger quantities of grapefruit juice. Patients should discuss all medication, both prescription and over the counter, with their healthcare professional.. 17.2 Liver Enzymes. It is recommended that liver function tests be performed before the initiation of simvastatin tablets, and thereafter when clinically indicated. All patients treated with simvastatin should be advised to report promptly any symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice.. 17.3 Pregnancy. Women of childbearing age should be advised to use an effective method of birth control to prevent pregnancy while using simvastatin tablets.

Butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules should be prescribed with caution for certain special-risk patients such as the elderly or debilitated, and those with severe impairment of renal or hepatic function, coagulation disorders, head injuries, elevated intracranial pressure, acute abdominal conditions, hypothyroidism, urethral stricture, Addisons disease, or prostatic hypertrophy.Aspirin should be used with caution in patients on anticoagulant therapy and in patients with underlying hemostatic defects, and extreme caution in the presence of peptic ulcer.Precautions should be taken when administering salicylates to persons with known allergies. Hypersensitivity to aspirin is particularly likely in patients with nasal polyps, and relatively common in those with asthma.. Information for Patients. Patients should be informed that butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules contain aspirin and should not be taken by patients with an aspirin allergy. Serious Skin Reactions, including DRESSAdvise patients to stop taking butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules immediately if they develop any type of rash or fever and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible [see WARNINGS ].Butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving car or operating machinery. Such tasks should be avoided while taking butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules. Alcohol and other CNS depressants may produce an additive CNS depression when taken with butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules and should be avoided. Butalbital may be habit-forming. Patients should take the drug only for as long as it is prescribed, in the amounts prescribed, and no more frequently than prescribed. PregnancyEmbryo-Fetal ToxicityInform pregnant women to avoid use of aspirin and other NSAIDs starting at 30 weeks gestation because of the risk of the premature closing of the fetal ductus arteriosus. If treatment with butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules is needed for pregnant woman between about 20 to 30 weeks gestation, advise her that she may need to be monitored for oligohydramnios, if treatment continues for longer than 48 hours [see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity, PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy ].. Laboratory Tests. In patients with severe hepatic or renal disease, effects of therapy should be monitored with serial liver and/or renal function tests.. Drug Interactions. The CNS effects of butalbital may be enhanced by monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.In patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids and chronic use of aspirin, withdrawal of corticosteroids may result in salicylism because corticosteroids enhance renal clearance of salicylates and their withdrawal is followed by return to normal rates of renal clearance.Butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules may enhance the effects of:Oral anticoagulants, causing bleeding by inhibiting prothrombin formation in the liver and displacing anticoagulants from plasma protein binding sites.Oral antidiabetic agents and insulin, causing hypoglycemia by contributing an additive effect, if dosage of butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules exceeds maximum recommended daily dosage.6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, causing bone marrow toxicity and blood dyscrasias by displacing these drugs from secondary binding sites, and, in the case of methotrexate, also reducing its excretion.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, increasing the risk of peptic ulceration and bleeding by contributing additive effects.Other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.Butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules may diminish the effects of:Uricosuric agents such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, reducing their effectiveness in the treatment of gout. Aspirin competes with these agents for protein binding sites..

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions. Aspirin: Aspirin may interfere with the following laboratory determinations in blood: serum amylase, fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, protein, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), uric acid, prothrombin time and bleeding time. Aspirin may interfere with the following laboratory determinations in urine: glucose, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, Gerhardt ketone, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), uric acid, diacetic acid, and spectrophotometric detection of barbiturates.. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility. Adequate long-term studies have been conducted in mice and rats with aspirin, alone or in combination with other drugs, in which no evidence of carcinogenesis was seen. No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether aspirin has potential for mutagenesis or impairment of fertility. No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether butalbital has potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility.. Pregnancy. Risk SummaryWithdrawal seizures were reported in two-day-old male infant whose mother had taken butalbital-containing drug during the last months of pregnancy. Butalbital was found in the infants serum. The infant was given phenobarbital mg/kg, which was tapered without further seizure or other withdrawal symptoms.Use of NSAIDs, including butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy [see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity ]. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus ArteriosusUse of NSAIDs, including butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal ImpairmentUse of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment.Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules. It is also not known whether butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules should be given to pregnant woman only when clearly needed.Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as aspirin, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses.The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsFetal/Neonatal Adverse ReactionsPremature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus [see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity ].Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules and follow up according to clinical practice [see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity ].DataHuman DataPremature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and post-marketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis.Methodological limitations of these post-marketing studies and reports include lack of control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain.. Labor and Delivery. Ingestion of aspirin prior to delivery may prolong delivery or lead to bleeding in the mother or neonate.. Nursing Mothers. Aspirin, caffeine, and barbiturates are excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of their effects on nursing infants is not known. Because of potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules, decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.. Pediatric Use. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.",ba60b130-33cd-4db9-92a7-2cab8ded0737,42232-9,PRECAUTIONS SECTION
28364689,"8.1 Pregnancy. Pregnancy Category D.[see Warnings and Precautions 5.7)] Topiramate can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant woman. Data from pregnancy registries indicate that infants exposed to topiramate in utero have an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts) and for being small for gestational age. When multiple species of pregnant animals received topiramate at clinically relevant doses, structural malformations, including craniofacial defects, and reduced fetal weights occurred in offspring. Topiramate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to fetus [see Use in Specific Populations 8.8)] Pregnancy RegistryPatients should be encouraged to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll-free number 1-888-233-2334. Information about the North American Drug Pregnancy Registry can be found at http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Human Data Data from pregnancy registries indicate an increased risk of oral clefts in infants exposed to topiramate during the first trimester of pregnancy. In the NAAED pregnancy registry, the prevalence of oral clefts among topiramate-exposed infants (1.1%) was higher than the prevalence of infants exposed to reference AED (0.36%) or the prevalence of infants in mothers without epilepsy and without exposure to AEDs (0.12%). It was also higher than the background prevalence in United States (0.17%) as estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The relative risk of oral clefts in topiramate-exposed pregnancies in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry was 9.6 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] to 23) as compared to the risk in background population of untreated women. The UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register reported prevalence of oral clefts among infants exposed to topiramate monotherapy (3.2%) that was 16 times higher than the background rate in the UK (0.2%).Data from the NAAED pregnancy registry and population-based birth registry cohort indicate that exposure to topiramate in utero is associated with an increased risk of small for gestational age (SGA) newborns (birth weight <10th percentile). In the NAAED pregnancy registry, 19.7% of topiramate-exposed newborns were SGA compared to 7.9% of newborns exposed to reference AED and 5.4% of newborns of mothers without epilepsy and without AED exposure. In the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN), population-based pregnancy registry, 25% of newborns in the topiramate monotherapy exposure group were SGA compared to % in the comparison group unexposed to AEDs. The long term consequences of the SGA findings are not known.Topiramate treatment can cause metabolic acidosis [see Warnings and Precautions 5.4)] The effect of topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis has not been studied in pregnancy; however, metabolic acidosis in pregnancy (due to other causes) can cause decreased fetal growth, decreased fetal oxygenation, and fetal death, and may affect the fetus ability to tolerate labor. Pregnant patients should be monitored for metabolic acidosis and treated as in the nonpregnant state [see Warnings and Precautions 5.4)] Newborns of mothers treated with topiramate should be monitored for metabolic acidosis because of transfer of topiramate to the fetus and possible occurrence of transient metabolic acidosis following birth. Animal DataTopiramate has demonstrated selective developmental toxicity, including teratogenicity, in multiple animal species at clinically relevant doses. When oral doses of 20, 100 or 500 mg/kg were administered to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis, the incidence of fetal malformations (primarily craniofacial defects) was increased at all doses. The low dose is approximately 0.2 times the recommended human dose (RHD) 400 mg/day on mg/m 2basis. Fetal body weights and skeletal ossification were reduced at 500 mg/kg in conjunction with decreased maternal body weight gain. In rat studies (oral doses of 20, 100, and 500 mg/kg or 0.2, 2.5, 30, and 400 mg/kg), the frequency of limb malformations (ectrodactyly, micromelia, and amelia) was increased among the offspring of dams treated with 400 mg/kg (10 times the RHD on mg/m 2basis) or greater during the organogenesis period of pregnancy. Embryotoxicity (reduced fetal body weights, increased incidence of structural variations) was observed at doses as low as 20 mg/kg (0.5 times the RHD on mg/m 2basis). Clinical signs of maternal toxicity were seen at 400 mg/kg and above, and maternal body weight gain was reduced during treatment with 100 mg/kg or greater. In rabbit studies (20, 60, and 180 mg/kg or 10, 35, and 120 mg/kg orally during organogenesis), embryo/fetal mortality was increased at 35 mg/kg (2 times the RHD on mg/m 2basis) or greater, and teratogenic effects (primarily rib and vertebral malformations) were observed at 120 mg/kg (6 times the RHD on mg/m 2basis). Evidence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain, clinical signs, and/or mortality) was seen at 35 mg/kg and above. When female rats were treated during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation (0.2, 4, 20, and 100 mg/kg or 2, 20, and 200 mg/kg), offspring exhibited decreased viability and delayed physical development at 200 mg/kg (5 times the RHD on mg/m 2basis) and reductions in pre-and/or postweaning body weight gain at mg/kg (0.05 times the RHD on mg/m basis) and above. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain, clinical signs) was evident at 100 mg/kg or greater. In rat embryo/fetal development study with postnatal component (0.2, 2.5, 30, or 400 mg/kg during organogenesis; noted above), pups exhibited delayed physical development at 400 mg/kg (10 times the RHD on mg/m 2basis) and persistent reductions in body weight gain at 30 mg/kg (1 times the RHD on mg/m 2basis) and higher.",835e5fa5-c602-8787-e053-2991aa0a7ba5,42228-7,PREGNANCY SECTION

28145956,"13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY. 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility. Valsartan-Hydrochlorothiazide: No carcinogenicity, mutagenicity or fertility studies have been conducted with the combination of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide. However, these studies have been conducted for valsartan as well as hydrochlorothiazide alone. Based on the preclinical safety and human pharmacokinetic studies, there is no indication of any adverse interaction between valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide.Valsartan: There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when valsartan was administered in the diet to mice and rats for up to years at doses up to 160 and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses in mice and rats are about 2.6 and times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose on mg/m2 basis. (Calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and 60-kg patient.)Mutagenicity assays did not reveal any valsartan-related effects at either the gene or chromosome level. These assays included bacterial mutagenicity tests with Salmonella (Ames) and E. coli; gene mutation test with Chinese hamster V79 cells; cytogenetic test with Chinese hamster ovary cells; and rat micronucleus test.Valsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is about times the maximum recommended human dose on mg/m2 basis. (Calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and 60-kg patient.) Hydrochlorothiazide: Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately 600 mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to approximately 100 mg/kg/day). The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice.Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames mutagenicity assay of Salmonella Typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 and in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations, or in vivo in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. Positive test results were obtained only in the in vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) and in the Mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide from 43 to 1300 mcg/mL, and in the Aspergillus Nidulans non-disjunction assay at an unspecified concentration.Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and mg/kg, respectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation. These doses of hydrochlorothiazide in mice and rats represent 19 and 1.5 times, respectively, the MRHD dose on mg/m2 basis. (Calculations assume an oral dose of 25 mg/day and 60-kg patient.). 13.3 Developmental Toxicity Studies. Valsartan-Hydrochlorothiazide: There was no evidence of teratogenicity in mice, rats, or rabbits treated orally with valsartan at doses up to 600, 100 and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively, in combination with hydrochlorothiazide at doses up to 188, 31 and mg/kg/day. These non-teratogenic doses in mice, rats and rabbits, respectively, represent 9, 3.5 and 0.5 times the MRHD of valsartan and 38, 13 and times the MRHD of hydrochlorothiazide on mg/m2 basis. (Calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day valsartan in combination with 25 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide and 60-kg patient.) Fetotoxicity was observed in association with maternal toxicity in rats and rabbits at valsartan doses of >=200 and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively, in combination with hydrochlorothiazide doses of >=63 and mg/kg/day. Fetotoxicity in rats was considered to be related to decreased fetal weights and included fetal variations of sternebrae, vertebrae, ribs and/or renal papillae. Fetotoxicity in rabbits included increased numbers of late resorptions with resultant increases in total resorptions, postimplantation losses and decreased number of live fetuses. The no observed adverse effect doses in mice, rats and rabbits for valsartan were 600, 100 and mg/kg/day, respectively, in combination with hydrochlorothiazide doses of 188, 31 and mg/kg/day. These no adverse effect doses in mice, rats and rabbits, respectively, represent 9, and 0.18 times the MRHD of valsartan and 38, 13 and 0.5 times the MRHD of hydrochlorothiazide on mg/m2 basis. (Calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day valsartan in combination with 25 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide and 60-kg patient.) Valsartan: No teratogenic effects were observed when valsartan was administered to pregnant mice and rats at oral doses up to 600 mg/kg/day and to pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day. However, significant decreases in fetal weight, pup birth weight, pup survival rate, and slight delays in developmental milestones were observed in studies in which parental rats were treated with valsartan at oral, maternally toxic (reduction in body weight gain and food consumption) doses of 600 mg/kg/day during organogenesis or late gestation and lactation. In rabbits, fetotoxicity (i.e., resorptions, litter loss, abortions, and low body weight) associated with maternal toxicity (mortality) was observed at doses of and 10 mg/kg/day. The no observed adverse effect doses of 600, 200 and mg/kg/day in mice, rats and rabbits represent 9, and 0.1 times, respectively, the MRHD on mg/m2 basis. (Calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and 60-kg patient.)Hydrochlorothiazide: Under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program, pregnant mice and rats that received hydrochlorothiazide via gavage at doses up to 3000 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively, on gestation days through 15 showed no evidence of teratogenicity. These doses of hydrochlorothiazide in mice and rats represent 608 and 405 times, respectively, the MRHD on mg/m2 basis.

28005990,"ADVERSE REACTIONS. Adverse effects considered to be related to therapy with cefaclor are listed below: Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in about 1.5% of patients and include morbilliform eruptions (1 in 100). Pruritus, urticaria, and positive Coombs tests each occur in less than in 200 patients. Cases of serum-sickness-like reactions have been reported with the use of cefaclor. These are characterized by findings of erythema multiforme, rashes, and other skin manifestations accompanied by arthritis/arthralgia, with or without fever, and differ from classic serum sickness in that there is infrequently associated lymphadenopathy and proteinuria, no circulating immune complexes, and no evidence to date of sequelae of the reaction. Occasionally, solitary symptoms may occur, but do not represent serum-sickness-like reaction. While further investigation is ongoing, serum-sickness-like reactions appear to be due to hypersensitivity and more often occur during or following second (or subsequent) course of therapy with cefaclor. Such reactions have been reported more frequently in pediatric patients than in adults with an overall occurrence ranging from in 200 (0.5%) in one focused trial to in 8,346 (0.024%) in overall clinical trials (with an incidence in pediatric patients in clinical trials of 0.055%) to in 38,000 (0.003%) in spontaneous event reports. Signs and symptoms usually occur few days after initiation of therapy and subside within few days after cessation of therapy; occasionally these reactions have resulted in hospitalization, usually of short duration (median hospitalization 2 to days, based on postmarketing surveillance studies). In those requiring hospitalization, the symptoms have ranged from mild to severe at the time of admission with more of the severe reactions occurring in pediatric patients. Antihistamines and glucocorticoids appear to enhance resolution of the signs and symptoms. No serious sequelae have been reported. More severe hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and anaphylaxis have been reported rarely. Anaphylactoid events may be manifested by solitary symptoms, including angioedema, asthenia, edema (including face and limbs), dyspnea, paresthesias, syncope, hypotension, or vasodilatation. Anaphylaxis may be more common in patients with history of penicillin allergy. Rarely, hypersensitivity symptoms may persist for several months. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur in about 2.5% of patients and include diarrhea (1 in 70). Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment (See WARNING). Nausea and vomiting have been reported rarely. As with some penicillins and some other cephalosporins, transient hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported rarely. Other effects considered related to therapy included eosinophilia (1 in 50 patients), genital pruritus, moniliasis or vaginitis (about in 50 patients), and, rarely, thrombocytopenia or reversible interstitial nephritis. Causal Relationship UncertainCNS-Rarely, reversible hyperactivity, agitation, nervousness, insomnia, confusion, hypertonia, dizziness, hallucinations, and somnolence have been reported. Transitory abnormalities in clinical laboratory test results have been reported. Although they were of uncertain etiology, they are listed below to serve as alerting information for the physician. Hepatic-Slight elevations of AST, ALT, or alkaline phosphatase values (1 in 40). Hematopoietic-As has also been reported with other -lactam antibiotics, transient lymphocytosis, leukopenia, and, rarely, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and reversible neutropenia of possible clinical significance. There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time with or without clinical bleeding in patients receiving cefaclor and warfarin concomitantly. Renal-Slight elevations in BUN or serum creatinine (less than in 500) or abnormal urinalysis (less than in 200). Cephalosporin-class Adverse Reactions In addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed in patients treated with cefaclor, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics: fever, abdominal pain, superinfection, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hemorrhage, false positive test for urinary glucose, elevated bilirubin, elevated LDH, and pancytopenia. Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced. If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and OVERDOSAGE sections).

28168775,"1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE. Lisinopril tablets are an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor indicated for:Treatment of hypertension in adults and pediatric patients years of age and older (1.1) Adjunct therapy for heart failure (1.2) Treatment of Acute Myocardial Infarction (1.3 . Treatment of hypertension in adults and pediatric patients years of age and older (1.1) Adjunct therapy for heart failure (1.2) Treatment of Acute Myocardial Infarction (1.3 . 1.1 Hypertension. Lisinopril tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adult patients and pediatric patients years of age and older to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from wide variety of pharmacologic classes.Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Programs Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to lower blood pressure goal.Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.Lisinopril tablets may be administered alone or with other antihypertensive agents [see Clinical Studies 14.1 )].. 1.2 Heart Failure. Lisinopril tablets are indicated to reduce signs and symptoms of systolic heart failure [see Clinical Studies 14.2 )].. 1.3 Reduction of Mortality in Acute Myocardial Infarction.

28293480,"13.1 Carcinogenesis Mutagenesis Impairment Of Fertility. In lifetime bioassay in rats, levofloxacin exhibited no carcinogenic potential following daily dietary administration for years; the highest dose (100 mg/kg/day) was 1.4 times the highest recommended human dose (750 mg) based upon relative body surface area. Levofloxacin did not shorten the time to tumor development of UV-induced skin tumors in hairless albino (Skh-1) mice at any levofloxacin dose level and was therefore not photo-carcinogenic under conditions of this study. Dermal levofloxacin concentrations in the hairless mice ranged from 25 to 42 mcg/g at the highest levofloxacin dose level (300 mg/kg/day) used in the photo-carcinogenicity study. By comparison, dermal levofloxacin concentrations in human subjects receiving 750 mg of levofloxacin averaged approximately 11.8 mcg/g at Cmax. Levofloxacin was not mutagenic in the following assays: Ames bacterial mutation assay (S. typhimurium and E. coli), CHO/HGPRT forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, mouse dominant lethal test, rat unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and the mouse sister chromatid exchange assay. It was positive in the in vitro chromosomal aberration (CHL cell line) and sister chromatid exchange (CHL/IU cell line) assays. Levofloxacin caused no impairment of fertility or reproductive performance in rats at oral doses as high as 360 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 4.2 times the highest recommended human dose based upon relative body surface area and intravenous doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 1.2 times the highest recommended human dose based upon relative body surface area.",daa51cd2-b877-488a-b4a1-3b06487627c6,34083-6,CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY SECTION

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.. 7.3 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS). Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on valsartan and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not coadminister aliskiren with valsartan in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with valsartan in patients with renal impairment (GFR 60 mL/min).. 7.4 Lithium. Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.",fb3ef419-fb3b-4a40-9151-938741d26ade,34073-7,DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION

27906615,"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. Microbiology. Although clindamycin palmitate HCl is inactive in vitro, rapid in vivo hydrolysis converts this compound to the antibacterially active clindamycin.Clindamycin has been shown to have in vitro activity against isolates of the following organisms:Aerobic gram positive cocci, including:Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and non-penicillinase producing strains). When tested by in vitro methods some staphylococcal strains originally resistant to erythromycin rapidly develop resistance to clindamycin.Staphylococcus epidermidis (penicillinase and non-penicillinase producing strains). When tested by in vitro methods some staphylococcal strains originally resistant to erythromycin rapidly develop resistance to clindamycin.Streptococci (except Streptococcus faecalis)PneumococciAnaerobic gram negative bacilli, including:Bacteroides species (including Bacteroides fragilis group and Bacteroides melaninogenicus group)Fusobacterium speciesAnaerobic gram positive nonsporeforming bacilli, including:PropionibacteriumEubacteriumActinomyces speciesAnaerobic and microaerophilic gram positive cocci, including:Peptococcus speciesPeptostreptococcus speciesMicroaerophilic streptococciClostridia: Clostridia are more resistant than most anaerobes to clindamycin.Most Clostridium perfringens are susceptible, but other species, e.g., Clostridium sporogenes and Clostridium tertium are frequently resistant to clindamycin. Susceptibility testing should be done.Cross resistance has been demonstrated between clindamycin and lincomycin.Antagonism has been demonstrated between clindamycin and erythromycin.. Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and non-penicillinase producing strains). When tested by in vitro methods some staphylococcal strains originally resistant to erythromycin rapidly develop resistance to clindamycin..

Peptostreptococcus species. Microaerophilic streptococci. Human Pharmacology. Blood level studies comparing clindamycin palmitate HCl with clindamycin hydrochloride show that both drugs reach their peak active serum levels at the same time, indicating rapid hydrolysis of the palmitate to the clindamycin.Clindamycin is widely distributed in body fluids and tissues (including bones). Approximately 10% of the biological activity is excreted in the urine. The average serum half-life after doses of CLEOCIN PEDIATRIC is approximately two hours in pediatric patients.Serum half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum.Serum level studies with clindamycin palmitate HCl in normal pediatric patients weighing 50-100 lbs given 2, or mg/kg every hours (8, 12 or 16 mg/kg/day) demonstrated mean peak clindamycin serum levels of 1.24, 2.25 and 2.44 mcg/mL respectively, one hour after the first dose. By the fifth dose, the 6-hour serum concentration had reached equilibrium. Peak serum concentrations after this time would be about 2.46, 2.98 and 3.79 mcg/mL with doses of 8, 12 and 16 mg/kg/day, respectively.Serum levels have been uniform and predictable from person to person and dose to dose. Multiple-dose studies in neonates and infants up to months of age show that the drug does not accumulate in the serum and is excreted rapidly. Serum levels exceed the MICs for most indicated organisms for at least six hours following administration of the usually recommended doses of CLEOCIN PEDIATRIC in adults and pediatric patients.No significant levels of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid, even in the presence of inflamed meninges.Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61-79 years) and younger adults (18-39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate.After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4.0 hours (range 3.4 5.1 h) in the elderly compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1 4.2 h) in younger adults; administration of clindamycin palmitate HCl resulted in similar elimination half-life value of about 4.5 hours in elderly subjects. However, the extent of absorption is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function1.",b225ab20-bc7c-43af-ae93-0f07d5948e1c,34090-1,CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION
28660458,"14 CLINICAL STUDIES. Clinical trials have not been conducted with fenofibrate capsules.. 14.1Primary Hypercholesterolemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia. The effects of fenofibrate at dose equivalent to 150 mg per day of fenofibrate were assessed from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group studies including patients with the following mean baseline lipid values: total-c 306.9 mg/dL; LDL-C 213.8 mg/dL; HDL-C 52.3 mg/dL; and triglycerides 191.0 mg/dL. Fenofibrate therapy lowered LDL-C, total-c, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Fenofibrate therapy also lowered triglycerides and raised HDL-C (see Table 4).Table 4:Mean Percent Change in Lipid Parameters at End of TreatmentDuration of study treatment was to months.

The effects of fenofibrate on serum triglycerides were studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 147 hypertriglyceridemic patients. Patients were treated for eight weeks under protocols that differed only in that one entered patients with baseline TG levels of 500 to 1500 mg/dL, and the other TG levels of 350 to 500 mg/dL. In patients with hypertriglyceridemia and normal cholesterolemia with or without hyperchylomicronemia, treatment with fenofibrate at dosages equivalent to 150 mg fenofibrate per day decreased primarily very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol. Treatment of some with elevated triglycerides often results in an increase of LDL-C (see Table 5).Table 5:Effects in Patients With Severe HypertriglyceridemiaStudy 1PlaceboFenofibrateBaseline TG Levels 350 to 499 mg/dLNBaseline (Mean)Endpoint (Mean)% Change (Mean)NBaseline (Mean)Endpoint (Mean)% Change (Mean)Triglycerides28449450-0.527432223-46.2P<0.05 vs. Placebo VLDL Triglycerides193673502.719350178-44.1 Total Cholesterol282552612.827252227-9.1 HDL Cholesterol283536427344019.6 LDL Cholesterol28120129122712813714.5VLDL Cholesterol2799995.8279246-44.7 Study 2PlaceboFenofibrateBaseline TG Levels 500 to 1500 mg/dLNBaseline (Mean)Endpoint (Mean)% Change (Mean)NBaseline (Mean)Endpoint (Mean)% Change (Mean)Triglycerides447107507.248726308-54.5 VLDL Triglycerides2953757118.733543205-50.6 Total Cholesterol442722710.448261223-13.8 HDL Cholesterol4427285.048303622.9 LDL Cholesterol4210090-4.24510313145.0 VLDL Cholesterol4213714211.04512654-49.4 The effect of fenofibrate on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.",3a69e15a-eda6-4a6e-8934-6881e4370521,34092-7,CLINICAL STUDIES SECTION

28621438,"6 ADVERSE REACTIONS. Serious cardiac reactions, including myocardial infarction, have occurred following the use of almotriptan tablets. These reactions are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Reactions reported in association with triptans have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation [see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Sensations of Pain, Tightness, Pressure in the Chest and/or Throat, Neck, and Jaw [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Cerebrovascular Events and Fatalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Other Vasospasm-Related Events, Including Peripheral Vascular Ischemia and Colonic Ischemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Increases in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Adverse events were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included 1840 adult patients who received one or two doses of almotriptan tablets and 386 adult patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reactions during treatment with almotriptan tabletswere nausea, somnolence, headache, paresthesia, and dry mouth. In long-term open-label studies where patients were allowed to treat multiple attacks for up to year, 5% (63 out of 1347 patients) withdrew due to adverse experiences. Adverse events were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included 362 adolescent patients who received almotriptan tablets and 172 adolescent patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reactions during treatment with almotriptan tablets were dizziness, somnolence, headache, paresthesia, nausea, and vomiting. In long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple attacks for up to year, 2% (10 out of 420 adolescent patients) withdrew due to adverse events. Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice..

Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets dosage should be increased slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake (5.14) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity. General Information on HepatotoxicityHepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate. These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months of valproate therapy. However, healthcare providers should not rely totally on serum biochemistry since these tests may not be abnormal in all instances, but should also consider the results of careful interim medical history and physical examination. Caution should be observed when administering valproate products to patients with prior history of hepatic disease. Patients on multiple anticonvulsants, children, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease may be at particular risk. See below, Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease.Experience has indicated that children under the age of two years are at considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions. When divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. In progressively older patient groups experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably.Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial DiseaseDivalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under two years of age who are clinically suspected of having mitochondrial disorder [see Contraindications (4)]. Valproate-induced acute liver failure and liver-related deaths have been reported in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by mutations in the gene for mitochondrial DNA polymerase (POLG) (e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) at higher rate than those without these syndromes. Most of the reported cases of liver failure in patients with these syndromes have been identified in children and adolescents. POLG-related disorders should be suspected in patients with family history or suggestive symptoms of POLG-related disorder, including but not limited to unexplained encephalopathy, refractory epilepsy (focal, myoclonic), status epilepticus at presentation, developmental delays, psychomotor regression, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, myopathy cerebellar ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, or complicated migraine with occipital aura. POLG mutation testing should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice for the diagnostic evaluation of such disorders. The A467T and W748S mutations are present in approximately 2/3 of patients with autosomal recessive POLG-related disorders.In patients over two years of age who are clinically suspected of having hereditary mitochondrial disease, divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets should only be used after other anticonvulsants have failed. This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver test monitoring.The drug should be discontinued immediately in the presence of significant hepatic dysfunction, suspected or apparent. In some cases, hepatic dysfunction has progressed in spite of discontinuation of drug [see Boxed Warning and Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Structural Birth Defects. Valproate can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant woman. Pregnancy registry data show that maternal valproate use can cause neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to mothers using valproate is about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers using other anti-seizure monotherapies. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.3 Decreased IQ Following in utero Exposure Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure. Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower cognitive test scores than children exposed in utero to either another antiepileptic drug or to no antiepileptic drugs. The largest of these studies is prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n=62) had lower IQ scores at age (97 [95% C.I. 94 to 101]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine (108 [95% C.I. 105 to 110]), carbamazepine (105 [95% C.I. 102 to 108]), and phenytoin (108 [95% C.I. 104 to 112]). It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproate-exposed children occur. Because the women in this study were exposed to antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed. Although all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that valproate exposure in utero can cause decreased IQ in children. In animal studies, offspring with prenatal exposure to valproate had malformations similar to those seen in humans and demonstrated neurobehavioral deficits [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.4 Use in Women of Childbearing Potential. Because of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, and major congenital malformations (including neural tube defects), which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be administered to woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. This is especially important when valproate use is considered for condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death such as prophylaxis of migraine headaches [see Contraindications (4)]. Women should use effective contraception while using valproate. Women of childbearing potential should be counseled regularly regarding the relative risks and benefits of valproate use during pregnancy. This is especially important for women planning pregnancy and for girls at the onset of puberty; alternative therapeutic options should be considered for these patients [see Boxed Warning and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. To prevent major seizures, valproate should not be discontinued abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life.Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population. It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation. Dietary folic acid supplementation both prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients using valproate.. 5.5 Pancreatitis. Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate. Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with rapid progression from initial symptoms to death. Some cases have occurred shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use. The rate based upon the reported cases exceeds that expected in the general population and there have been cases in which pancreatitis recurred after rechallenge with valproate. In clinical trials, there were cases of pancreatitis without alternative etiology in 2,416 patients, representing 1,044 patient-years experience. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. If pancreatitis is diagnosed, divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets should ordinarily be discontinued. Alternative treatment for the underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated [see Boxed Warning]. 5.6 Urea Cycle Disorders. Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with known urea cycle disorders (UCD).Hyperammonemic encephalopathy, sometimes fatal, has been reported following initiation of valproate therapy in patients with urea cycle disorders, group of uncommon genetic abnormalities, particularly ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Prior to the initiation of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets therapy, evaluation for UCD should be considered in the following patients: 1) those with history of unexplained encephalopathy or coma, encephalopathy associated with protein load, pregnancy-related or postpartum encephalopathy, unexplained mental retardation, or history of elevated plasma ammonia or glutamine; 2) those with cyclical vomiting and lethargy, episodic extreme irritability, ataxia, low BUN, or protein avoidance; 3) those with family history of UCD or family history of unexplained infant deaths (particularly males); 4) those with other signs or symptoms of UCD. Patients who develop symptoms of unexplained hyperammonemic encephalopathy while receiving valproate therapy should receive prompt treatment (including discontinuation of valproate therapy) and be evaluated for underlying urea cycle disorders [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 5.7 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.Table shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.Table 1. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled AnalysisIndicationPlacebo Patients with Events Per 1,000 PatientsDrug Patients with Events Per 1,000 PatientsRelative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo PatientsRisk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1,000 PatientsEpilepsy13.43.52.4Psychiatric5.78.51.52.9Other11.81.90.9Total2.44.31.81.9The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.Anyone considering prescribing divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.. 5.8 Bleeding and Other Hematopoietic Disorders. Valproate is associated with dose-related thrombocytopenia. In clinical trial of valproate as monotherapy in patients with epilepsy, 34/126 patients (27%) receiving approximately 50 mg/kg/day on average, had at least one value of platelets <= 75 10 9/L. Approximately half of these patients had treatment discontinued, with return of platelet counts to normal. In the remaining patients, platelet counts normalized with continued treatment. In this study, the probability of thrombocytopenia appeared to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of >= 110 mcg/mL (females) or >= 135 mcg/mL (males). The therapeutic benefit which may accompany the higher doses should therefore be weighed against the possibility of greater incidence of adverse effects. Valproate use has also been associated with decreases in other cell lines and myelodysplasia. Because of reports of cytopenias, inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation, and abnormal coagulation parameters, (e.g., low fibrinogen, coagulation factor deficiencies, acquired von Willebrands disease), measurements of complete blood counts and coagulation tests are recommended before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals. It is recommended that patients receiving divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets be monitored for blood counts and coagulation parameters prior to planned surgery and during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Evidence of hemorrhage, bruising, or disorder of hemostasis/coagulation is an indication for reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of therapy. 5.9 Hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia has been reported in association with valproate therapy and may be present despite normal liver function tests. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy and vomiting or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured. Hyperammonemia should also be considered in patients who present with hypothermia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. If ammonia is increased, valproate therapy should be discontinued. Appropriate interventions for treatment of hyperammonemia should be initiated, and such patients should undergo investigation for underlying urea cycle disorders [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.10)]. Asymptomatic elevations of ammonia are more common and when present, require close monitoring of plasma ammonia levels. If the elevation persists, discontinuation of valproate therapy should be considered.. 5.10 Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy Associated with Concomitant Topiramate Use. Concomitant administration of topiramate and valproate has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting. Hypothermia can also be manifestation of hyperammonemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. In most cases, symptoms and signs abated with discontinuation of either drug. This adverse reaction is not due to pharmacokinetic interaction. Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, an interaction of topiramate and valproate may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.9)]. 5.11 Hypothermia. Hypothermia, defined as an unintentional drop in body core temperature to <35C (95F), has been reported in association with valproate therapy both in conjunction with and in the absence of hyperammonemia. This adverse reaction can also occur in patients using concomitant topiramate with valproate after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Consideration should be given to stopping valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels. 5.12 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking valproate. DRESS may be fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Valproate should be discontinued and not be resumed if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.. 5.13 Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics. Carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not complete list) may reduce serum valproate concentrations to subtherapeutic levels, resulting in loss of seizure control. Serum valproate concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproate concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.14 Somnolence in the Elderly. In double-blind, multicenter trial of valproate in elderly patients with dementia (mean age 83 years), doses were increased by 125 mg/day to target dose of 20 mg/kg/day. significantly higher proportion of valproate patients had somnolence compared to placebo, and although not statistically significant, there was higher proportion of patients with dehydration. Discontinuations for somnolence were also significantly higher than with placebo. In some patients with somnolence (approximately one-half), there was associated reduced nutritional intake and weight loss. There was trend for the patients who experienced these events to have lower baseline albumin concentration, lower valproate clearance, and higher BUN. In elderly patients, dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.15 Monitoring: Drug Plasma Concentration. Since valproate may interact with concurrently administered drugs which are capable of enzyme induction, periodic plasma concentration determinations of valproate and concomitant drugs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.16 Effect on Ketone and Thyroid Function Tests. Valproate is partially eliminated in the urine as keto-metabolite which may lead to false interpretation of the urine ketone test.There have been reports of altered thyroid function tests associated with valproate. The clinical significance of these is unknown.. 5.17 Effect on HIV and CMV Viruses Replication. There are in vitro studies that suggest valproate stimulates the replication of the HIV and CMV viruses under certain experimental conditions. The clinical consequence, if any, is not known. Additionally, the relevance of these in vitro findings is uncertain for patients receiving maximally suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Nevertheless, these data should be borne in mind when interpreting the results from regular monitoring of the viral load in HIV infected patients receiving valproate or when following CMV infected patients clinically. 5.18 Medication Residue in the Stool. There have been rare reports of medication residue in the stool. Some patients have had anatomic (including ileostomy or colostomy) or functional gastrointestinal disorders with shortened GI transit times. In some reports, medication residues have occurred in the context of diarrhea. It is recommended that plasma valproate levels be checked in patients who experience medication residue in the stool, and patients clinical condition should be monitored. If clinically indicated, alternative treatment may be considered.",64b509bc-f398-48ad-bdcb-9904e61d9225,43685-7,WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION

28264242,"PRECAUTIONS. General. Impaired renal functionAs consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with ACE inhibitors, including quinapril, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely acute renal failure and/or death. In clinical studies in hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine have been observed in some patients following ACE inhibitor therapy. These increases were almost always reversible upon discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy.Some patients with hypertension or heart failure with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when quinapril has been given concomitantly with diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of any diuretic and/or quinapril may be required.Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).Hyperkalemia In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium >=5.8 mmol/L) occurred in approximately 2% of patients receiving quinapril. In most cases, elevated serum potassium levels were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Less than 0.1% of patients discontinued therapy due to hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels. Monitor serum potassium in such patients (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). CoughPresumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent non-productive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.Surgery/anesthesiaIn patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, quinapril will block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.. Information for Patients. PregnancyTell female patients of childbearing age about the consequences of exposure to quinapril during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Ask patients to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible.AngioedemaAngioedema, including laryngeal edema can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Advise patients and tell them to immediately report any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, extremities, eyes, lips, tongue, difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to stop taking the drug until they have consulted with their physician (see WARNINGS ). Symptomatic hypotensionCaution patients that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first few days of quinapril therapy, and that it should be reported to physician. If actual syncope occurs, tell patients to temporarily discontinue the drug until they have consulted with their physician (see WARNINGS ). Caution all patients that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope.Tell patients planning to undergo any surgery and/or anesthesia to inform their physician that they are taking an ACE inhibitor.HyperkalemiaTell patients not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting their physician (see PRECAUTIONS ). NeutropeniaTell patients to promptly report any indication of infection (eg, sore throat, fever) which could be sign of neutropenia.NOTE: As with many other drugs, certain advice to patients being treated with quinapril is warranted. This information is intended to aid in the safe and effective use of this medication. It is not disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects.. Drug Interactions. Concomitant diuretic therapyAs with other ACE inhibitors, patients on diuretics, especially those on recently instituted diuretic therapy, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with quinapril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with quinapril may be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or cautiously increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with quinapril. If it is not possible to discontinue the diuretic, the starting dose of quinapril should be reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).Agents increasing serum potassiumCoadministration of quinapril with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Tetracycline and other drugs that interact with magnesiumSimultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril tablets. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium.LithiumIncreased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If diuretic is also used, it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity.GoldNitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors)In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including quinapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including quinapril may be attenuated by NSAIDs.Agents that inhibit mTOR or other drugs known to cause angioedemaPatients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus) therapy or neprilysin inhibitor may be at increased risk for angioedema.Other agentsDrug interaction studies of quinapril with other agents showed: Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril.The anticoagulant effect of single dose of warfarin (measured by prothrombin time) was not significantly changed by quinapril coadministration twice-daily.Quinapril treatment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly.Co-administration of multiple 10 mg doses of atorvastatin with 80 mg of quinapril resulted in no significant change in the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin.Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on quinapril and other agents that affect the RAS.Do not co-administer aliskiren with quinapril in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with quinapril in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2).. Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril.. The anticoagulant effect of single dose of warfarin (measured by prothrombin time) was not significantly changed by quinapril coadministration twice-daily.. Quinapril treatment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly.. Co-administration of multiple 10 mg doses of atorvastatin with 80 mg of quinapril resulted in no significant change in the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin.. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility. Quinapril hydrochloride was not carcinogenic in mice or rats when given in doses up to 75 or 100 mg/kg/day (50 to 60 times the maximum human daily dose, respectively, on an mg/kg basis and 3.8 to 10 times the maximum human daily dose when based on an mg/m2 basis) for 104 weeks. Female rats given the highest dose level had an increased incidence of mesenteric lymph node hemangiomas and skin/subcutaneous lipomas. Neither quinapril nor quinaprilat were mutagenic in the Ames bacterial assay with or without metabolic activation. Quinapril was also negative in the following genetic toxicology studies: in vitro mammalian cell point mutation, sister chromatid exchange in cultured mammalian cells, micronucleus test with mice, in vitro chromosome aberration with V79 cultured lung cells, and in an in vivo cytogenetic study with rat bone marrow. There were no adverse effects on fertility or reproduction in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (60 and 10 times the maximum daily human dose when based on mg/kg and mg/m2, respectively).. Nursing Mothers. Because quinapril is secreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when this drug is administered to nursing woman.. Pediatric Use. Neonates with history of in utero exposure to quinapril: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Removal of quinapril, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means.The safety and effectiveness of quinapril in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use. Clinical studies of quinapril did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.Elderly patients exhibited increased area under the plasma concentration time curve and peak levels for quinaprilat compared to values observed in younger patients; this appeared to relate to decreased renal function rather than to age itself.",a6cf2ffd-cf94-4f1c-a12e-ce0e93a6304d,42232-9,PRECAUTIONS SECTION
27897746,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. Hypertension. In patients who are currently being treated with diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally may occur following the initial dose of enalapril maleate. The diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued for two to three days before beginning therapy with enalapril maleate to reduce the likelihood of hypotension (see WARNINGS). If the patients blood pressure is not controlled with enalapril maleate alone, diuretic therapy may be resumed.If the diuretic cannot be discontinued an initial dose of 2.5 mg should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).The recommended initial dose in patients not on diuretics is mg once day. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. The usual dosage range is 10 to 40 mg per day administered in single dose or two divided doses. In some patients treated once daily, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. In such patients, an increase in dosage or twice daily administration should be considered. If blood pressure is not controlled with enalapril maleate alone, diuretic may be added.Concomitant administration of enalapril maleate with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS).. Dosage Adjustment in Hypertensive Patients With Renal Impairment. The usual dose of enalapril is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance 30 mL/min (serum creatinine of up to approximately mg/dL). For patients with creatinine clearance <= 30 mL/min (serum creatinine >= mg/dL), the first dose is 2.5 mg once daily.

Heart Failure. Enalapril maleate is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In the placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated improved survival, patients were titrated as tolerated up to 40 mg, administered in two divided doses.The recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg. The recommended dosing range is 2.5 to 20 mg given twice day. Doses should be titrated upward, as tolerated, over period of few days or weeks. The maximum daily dose administered in clinical trials was 40 mg in divided doses.After the initial dose of enalapril maleate, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). If possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced which may diminish the likelihood of hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of enalapril maleate does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension.. Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction. In the trial that demonstrated efficacy, patients were started on 2.5 mg twice daily and were titrated as tolerated to the targeted daily dose of 20 mg (in divided doses).After the initial dose of enalapril maleate, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). If possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced which may diminish the likelihood of hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of enalapril maleate does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension.. Dosage Adjustment in Patients With Heart Failure and Renal Impairment or Hyponatremia. In patients with heart failure who have hyponatremia (serum sodium less than 130 mEq/L) or with serum creatinine greater than 1.6 mg/dL, therapy should be initiated at 2.5 mg daily under close medical supervision (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Heart Failure; WARNINGS; and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). The dose may be increased to 2.5 mg b.i.d., then mg b.i.d. and higher as needed, usually at intervals of four days or more if at the time of dosage adjustment there is not excessive hypotension or significant deterioration of renal function. The maximum daily dose is 40 mg.. Pediatric Hypertensive Patients. The usual recommended starting dose is 0.08 mg/kg (up to mg) once daily. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. Doses above 0.58 mg/kg (or in excess of 40 mg) have not been studied in pediatric patients.See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Pharmacology in Pediatric Patients.Enalapril maleate is not recommended in neonates and in pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, as no data are available..

28365368,"Pharmacokinetics. Estimates of mean oral bioavailability of cyclobenzaprine range from 33% to 55%. Cyclobenzaprine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 2.5 mg to 10 mg, and is subject to enterohepatic circulation. It is highly bound to plasma proteins. Drug accumulates when dosed three times day, reaching steady-state within 3-4 days at plasma concentrations about four-fold higher than after single dose. At steady state in healthy subjects receiving 10 mg t.i.d. (n=18), peak plasma concentration was 25.9 ng/mL (range, 12.8-46.1 ng/mL), and area under the concentration-time (AUC) curve over an 8-hour dosing interval was 177 ng.hr/mL (range, 80-319 ng.hr/mL).Cyclobenzaprine is extensively metabolized, and is excreted primarily as glucuronides via the kidney. Cytochromes P-450 3A4, 1A2, and, to lesser extent, 2D6, mediate N-demethylation, one of the oxidative pathways for cyclobenzaprine. Cyclobenzaprine is eliminated quite slowly, with an effective half-life of 18 hours (range 8-37 hours; n=18); plasma clearance is 0.7 L/min.The plasma concentration of cyclobenzaprine is generally higher in the elderly and in patients with hepatic impairment.

28355027,"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS. Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of levothyroxine sodium tablets. (2.3, 8.1). 8.1 Pregnancy. Risk Summary. Experience with levothyroxine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages [see Data]. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and levothyroxine sodium tablets dosage adjusted during pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] There are no animal studies conducted with levothyroxine during pregnancy. Levothyroxine sodium tablets should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.. Clinical Considerations. Clinical Considerations. Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk. Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development.. Dose Adjustments During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period. Pregnancy may increase levothyroxine sodium tablets requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the levothyroxine sodium tablets dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the levothyroxine sodium tablets dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Data. Data. Human Data. Levothyroxine is approved for use as replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. There is long experience of levothyroxine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies that have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with levothyroxine use in pregnant women.. 8.2 Lactation. Risk Summary. Limited published studies report that levothyroxine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of Levothyroxine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of levothyroxine on milk production. Adequate levothyroxine treatment during lactation may normalize milk production in hypothyroid lactating mothers. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mothers clinical need for levothyroxine sodium tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from levothyroxine sodium tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.. 8.4 Pediatric Use. The initial dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patients clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)] In children in whom diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue levothyroxine sodium tablets administration for trial period, but only after the child is at least years of age. Obtain serum T4 and TSH levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessment to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted.. Congenital Hypothyroidism [See Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)]. Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate levothyroxine sodium tablets therapy immediately upon diagnosis. Levothyroxine is generally continued for life in these patients.Closely monitor infants during the first weeks of levothyroxine sodium tablets therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling.Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.. Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.Treated children may manifest period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height.. 8.5 Geriatric Use. Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate levothyroxine sodium tablets at less than the full replacement dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)] Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with levothyroxine overtreatment in the elderly.",66bb0ba9-cd63-4817-907f-7b8ad5dc6685,43684-0,USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS SECTION

28221748,"General. Fluid And Electrolytes. All patients receiving therapy with metolazone tablets, USP, should have serum electrolyte measurements done at appropriate intervals and be observed for clinical signs of fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance: namely, hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. In patients with severe edema accompanying cardiac failure or renal disease, low-salt syndrome may be produced, especially with hot weather and low-salt diet. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient has protracted vomiting, severe diarrhea, or is receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs of imbalance are: dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscle fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hyponatremia may occur at any time during long term therapy and, on rare occasions, may be life threatening.The risk of hypokalemia is increased when larger doses are used, when diuresis is rapid, when severe liver disease is present, when corticosteroids are given concomitantly, when oral intake is inadequate or when excess potassium is being lost extrarenally, such as with vomiting or diarrhea.Thiazide-like diuretics have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.. Glucose Tolerance. Metolazone may raise blood glucose concentrations possibly causing hyperglycemia and glycosuria in patients with diabetes or latent diabetes.. Hyperuricemia. Metolazone tablets, USP, regularly cause an increase in serum uric acid and can occasionally precipitate gouty attacks even in patients without prior history of them.. Azotemia. Azotemia, presumably prerenal azotemia, may be precipitated during the administration of metolazone tablets, USP. If azotemia and oliguria worsen during treatment of patients with severe renal disease, metolazone tablets, USP, should be discontinued.. Renal Impairment. Use caution when administering metolazone tablets, USP, to patients with severely impaired renal function. As most of the drug is excreted by the renal route, accumulation may occur.. Orthostatic Hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension may occur; this may be potentiated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics, or concurrent therapy with other antihypertensive drugs.. Hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia may infrequently occur with metolazone, especially in patients taking high doses of vitamin or with high bone turnover states, and may signify hidden hyperparathyroidism. Metolazone should be discontinued before tests for parathyroid function are performed.. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Thiazide diuretics have exacerbated or activated systemic lupus erythematosus and this possibility should be considered with metolazone tablets, USP.",364d09bb-5adc-4e84-af73-a77ad029bc53,34072-9,GENERAL PRECAUTIONS SECTION

28626167,"WARNINGS. In patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, furosemide therapy is best initiated in the hospital. In hepatic coma and in states of electrolyte depletion, therapy should not be instituted until the basic condition is improved. Sudden alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance in patients with cirrhosis may precipitate hepatic coma; therefore, strict observation is necessary during the period of arenter. Supplemental potassium chloride and, if required, an aldosterone antagonist are helpful in preventing hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.If increasing azotemia and oliguria occur during treatment of severe progressive renal disease, furosemide should be discontinued.Cases of tinnitus and reversible or irreversible hearing impairment and deafness have been reported. Reports usually indicate that furosemide ototoxicity is associated with rapid injection, severe renal impairment, the use of higher than recommended doses, hypoproteinemia or concomitant therapy with aminoglycoside antibiotics, ethacrynic acid, or other ototoxic drugs. If the physician elects to use high dose arenteral therapy, controlled intravenous infusion is advisable (for adults, an infusion rate not exceeding mg furosemide per minute has been used). (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions. . Pediatric Use. In premature neonates with respiratory distress syndrome, diuretic treatment with furosemide in the first few weeks of life may increase the risk of persistent patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), possibly through prostaglandin- E-mediated process.Literature reports indicate that premature infants with post conceptual age (gestational plus postnatal) less than 31 weeks receiving doses exceeding mg/kg/24 hours may develop plasma levels which could be associated with potential toxic effects including ototoxicity.Hearing loss in neonates has been associated with the use of furosemide injection (see WARNINGS, above).",b39ad6b3-401d-4aba-a0a9-6d56fcfa0ac9,34071-1,WARNINGS SECTION

28672436,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. In elderly patients the pharmacokinetics of metronidazole may be altered and, therefore, monitoring of serum levels may be necessary to adjust the metronidazole dosage accordingly.Treatment of Anaerobic Bacterial Infections:The recommended dosage schedule for Adults is:Parenteral therapy may be changed to oral metronidazole when conditions warrant, based upon the severity of the disease and the response of the patient to treatment with Metronidazole Injection, USP treatment. The usual adult oral dosage is 7.5 mg/kg every six hours (approximately 500 mg for 70-kg adult).A maximum of g should not be exceeded during 24-hour period.The usual duration of therapy is to 10 days; however, infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract, and endocardium may require longer treatment.Dosage AdjustmentsPatients with Severe Hepatic ImpairmentFor patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), the metronidazole dose should be reduced by 50% (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS).Patients Undergoing HemodialysisHemodialysis removes significant amounts of metronidazole and its metabolites from systemic circulation. The clearance of metronidazole will depend on the type of dialysis membrane used, the duration of the dialysis session, and other factors. If the administration of metronidazole cannot be separated from hemodialysis session, supplementation of metronidazole dosage following hemodialysis session should be considered, depending on the patients clinical situation (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).ProphylaxisFor surgical prophylactic use, to prevent postoperative infection in contaminated or potentially contaminated colorectal surgery, the recommended dosage schedule for adults is:It is important that (1) administration of the initial preoperative dose be completed approximately one hour before surgery so that adequate drug levels are present in the serum and tissues at the time of initial incision, and (2) Metronidazole Injection, USP be administered, if necessary, at 6-hour intervals to maintain effective drug levels. Prophylactic use of Metronidazole Injection, USP should be limited to the day of surgery only, following the above guidelines.CAUTION: Metronidazole Injection, USP is to be administered by slow intravenous drip infusion only, either as continuous or intermittent infusion. I.V. admixtures containing metronidazole and other drugs should be avoided. Additives should not be introduced into this solution. If used with primary intravenous fluid system, the primary solution should be discontinued during metronidazole infusion.

28392662,"10 OVERDOSAGE. In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures as required. prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at poison-control center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mg/kg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms. Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in small number of patients after overdosage with amoxicillin1. Crystalluria, in some cases leading to renal failure, has also been reported after amoxicillin overdosage in adult and pediatric patients. In case of overdosage, adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin crystalluria. Renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration. High blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of amoxicillin. Amoxicillin may be removed from circulation by hemodialysis.",b23637eb-16ff-4e92-96e5-d6efd5cc4ee8,34088-5,OVERDOSAGE SECTION
28606833,"WARNINGS. Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis. Lovastatin, like other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of myopathy is increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma.The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is dose related. In clinical study (EXCEL) in which patients were carefully monitored and some interacting drugs were excluded, there was one case of myopathy among 4933 patients randomized to lovastatin 20 to 40 mg daily for 48 weeks, and among 1649 patients randomized to 80 mg daily. All patients starting therapy with lovastatin, or whose dose of lovastatin is being increased, should be advised of the risk of myopathy and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing Lovastatin. Lovastatin therapy should be discontinued immediately if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. Periodic CK determinations may be considered in patients starting therapy with lovastatin or whose dose is being increased, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent myopathy. Many of the patients who have developed rhabdomyolysis on therapy with lovastatin have had complicated medical histories, including renal insufficiency usually as consequence of long-standing diabetes mellitus. Such patients merit closer monitoring. Lovastatin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Lovatsatin therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient experiencing an acute or serious condition predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis; hypotension; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy.The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant use of lovastatin with the following:. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4: Lovastatin, like several other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, is substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Certain drugs which inhibit this metabolic pathway can raise the plasma levels of lovastatin and may increase the risk of myopathy. These include itraconazole, ketoconazole, and posaconazole, voriconazole, the macrolide antibiotics erythromycin and clarithromycin, the ketolide antibiotic telithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, boceprevir, telaprevir, the antidepressant nefazodone, or cobicistat-containing products. Combination of these drugs with lovastatin is contraindicated. If short-term treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is unavoidable, therapy with lovastatin should be suspended during the course of treatment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS; PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Gemfibrozil:The combined use of lovastatin with gemfibrozil should be avoided.. Other lipid-lowering drugs (other fibrates or>=1 g/day of niacin): Caution should be used when prescribing other fibrates or lipid-lowering doses (>=1 g/day) of niacin with lovastatin, as these agents can cause myopathy when given alone. The benefit of further alterations in lipid levels by the combined use of lovastatin with other fibrates or niacin should be carefully weighed against the potential risks of these combinations. Cyclosporine:The use of lovastatin with cyclosporine should be avoided.. Danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone or verapamil with higher doses of lovastatin:The dose of lovastatin should not exceed 20 mg daily in patients receiving concomitant medication with danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone, or verapamil. The benefits of the use of lovastatin in patients receiving danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone, or verapamil should be carefully weighed against the risks of these combinations. Amiodarone:The dose of lovastatin should not exceed 40 mg daily in patients receiving concomitant medication with amiodarone. The combined use of lovastatin at doses higher than 40 mg daily with amiodarone should be avoided unless the clinical benefit is likely to outweigh the increased risk of myopathy. The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased when amiodarone is used concomitantly with higher doses of closely related member of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor class. Colchicine: Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with lovastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing lovastatin with colchicine (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Ranolazine: The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, may be increased by concomitant administration of ranolazine. Dose adjustment of lovastatin may be considered during coadministration with ranolazine. Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table VII (see also CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics; PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions; DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Table VII. Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuomuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Consider risk of IMNM carefully prior to initiation of different statin. If therapy is initiated with different statin, monitor for signs and symptoms of IMNM.. Liver Dysfunction. Persistent increases (to more than times the upper limit of normal) in serum transaminases occurred in 1.9% of adult patients who received lovastatin for at least one year in early clinical trials (seeADVERSE REACTIONS). When the drug was interrupted or discontinued in these patients, the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels. The increases usually appeared to 12 months after the start of therapy with lovastatin, and were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. There was no evidence of hypersensitivity. In the EXCEL study (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Clinical Studies ), the incidence of persistent increases in serum transaminases over 48 weeks was 0.1% for placebo, 0.1% at 20 mg/day, 0.9% at 40 mg/day, and 1.5% at 80 mg/day in patients on lovastatin. However, in post-marketing experience with lovastatin, symptomatic liver disease has been reported rarely at all dosages (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). In AFCAPS/TexCAPS, the number of participants with consecutive elevations of either alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (> times the upper limit of normal), over median of 5.1 years of follow-up, was not significantly different between the lovastatin and placebo groups (18 [0.6%] vs. 11 [0.3%]). The starting dose of lovastatin was 20 mg/day; 50% of the lovastatin treated participants were titrated to 40 mg/day at Week 18. Of the 18 participants on lovastatin with consecutive elevations of either ALT or AST, 11 (0.7%) elevations occurred in participants taking 20 mg/day, while (0.4%) elevations occurred in participants titrated to 40 mg/day. Elevated transaminases resulted in discontinuation of (0.2%) participants from therapy in the lovastatin group (n=3,304) and (0.1%) in the placebo group (n=3,301).It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with Lovastatin and repeated as clinically indicated.There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including lovastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with Lovastatin, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart Lovastatin.The drug should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have past history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of lovastatin.Moderate (less than three times the upper limit of normal) elevations of serum transaminases have been reported following therapy with lovastatin (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). These changes appeared soon after initiation of therapy with lovastatin, were often transient, were not accompanied by any symptoms and interruption of treatment was not required.",ac86821f-d741-4ab1-bd03-ce8797dd4f34,34071-1,WARNINGS SECTION

Tables and include drugs with clinically important drug interactions and interaction with diagnostics when administered concomitantly with Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules and instructions for preventing or managing them.Consult the labeling of concomitantly used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with PPIs.Table 3: Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs Co-Administered with Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules and Interaction with DiagnosticsAntiretrovirals Clinical Impact: The effect of PPIs on antiretroviral drugs is variable. The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known.Decreased exposure of some antiretroviral drugs (e.g., rilpivirine, atazanavir and nelfinavir) when used concomitantly with omeprazole may reduce antiviral effect and promote the development of drug resistance [see li i cal harmacology 12.3)] Increased exposure of other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., saquinavir) when used concomitantly with omeprazole may increase toxicity [see l n cal harmacology 12.3)] There are other antiretroviral drugs which do not result in clinically relevant interactions with omeprazole. Intervention: Rilpivirine-containing products: Concomitant use with Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules is contraindicated [see Contraindications 4)] Atazanavir: Avoid concomitant use with Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules. See prescribing information for atazanavir for dosing information. Nelfinavir: Avoid concomitant use with Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules. See prescribing information for nelfinavir. Saquinavir: See the prescribing information for saquinavir for monitoring of potential saquinavir-related toxicities. Other antiretrovirals: See prescribing information for specific antiretroviral drugs. Warfarin Clinical Impact: Increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs, including omeprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Intervention: Monitor INR and prothrombin time and adjust the dose of warfarin, if needed, to maintain target INR range. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of omeprazole with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. No formal drug interaction studies of high-dose methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see arnings and Precautions 5.11)] Intervention: temporary withdrawal of Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules may be considered in some patients receiving high-dose methotrexate. CYP2C19 Substrates (e.g., clopidogrel, citalopram, cilostazol, phenytoin, diazepam) Clopidogrel Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of omeprazole 80 mg results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and reduction in platelet inhibition [see li i cal harmacology 12.3)] There are no adequate combination studies of lower dose of omeprazole or higher dose of clopidogrel in comparison with the approved dose of clopidogrel. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use with Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules. Consider use of alternative anti-platelet therapy[see Warnings and Precautions 5.6)] Citalopram Clinical Impact: Increased exposure of citalopram leading to an increased risk of QT prolongation see li i cal Pharmacology 12.3)] Intervention: Limit the dose of citalopram to maximum of 20 mg per day. See prescribing information for citalopram. Cilostazol Clinical Impact: Increased exposure of one of the active metabolites of cilostazol (3,4-dihydro-cilostazol) [see l nical Pharmacology 12.3)] Intervention: Reduce the dose of cilostazol to 50 mg twice daily. See prescribing information for cilostazol. Phenytoin Clinical Impact: Potential for increased exposure of phenytoin. Intervention: Monitor phenytoin serum concentrations. Dose adjustment may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for phenytoin. Diazepam Clinical Impact: Increased exposure of diazepam [see l nical Pharmacology 12.3)] Intervention: Monitor patients for increased sedation and reduce the dose of diazepam as needed. Digoxin Clinical Impact: Potential for increased exposure of digoxin [see l n c al Pharmacology 12.3)] Intervention: Monitor digoxin concentrations. Dose adjustment may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See digoxin prescribing information. Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., iron salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenolate mofetil, ketoconazole/itraconazole) Clinical Impact: Omeprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity. Intervention: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Co-administration of omeprazole in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules and MMF. Use Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see l nical harmacology 12.3)] See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin and Amoxicillin Clinical Impact: Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with other drugs can lead to serious adverse reactions, including potentially fatal arrhythmias, and are contraindicated. Amoxicillin also has drug interactions. Intervention: See Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions in prescribing information for clarithromycin. See Drug Interactions in prescribing information for amoxicillin. Tacrolimus Clinical Impact: Potential for increased exposure of tacrolimus, especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C19. Intervention: Monitor tacrolimus whole blood concentrations. Dose adjustment may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for tacrolimus. Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors Clinical Impact: Serum chromogranin (CgA) levels increase secondary to PPI-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors [see arnings and Precautions 5.10), li i cal harmacology 12.2)] Intervention: Temporarily stop Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary. Interaction with Secretin Stimulation Test Clinical Impact: Hyper-response in gastrin secretion in response to secretin stimulation test, falsely suggesting gastrinoma. Intervention: Temporarily stop Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules treatment at least 14 days before assessing to allow gastrin levels to return to baseline [see Cl n cal Pharmacology 12.2)] False Positive Urine Tests for THC Clinical Impact: There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs. Intervention: An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. Other Clinical Impact: There have been clinical reports of interactions with other drugs metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system (e.g., cyclosporine, disulfiram). Intervention: Monitor patients to determine if it is necessary to adjust the dosage of these other drugs when taken concomitantly with Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules. Table 4: Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules When Co-Administered with Other DrugsCYP2C19 or CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact: Decreased exposure of omeprazole when used concomitantly with strong inducers [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.3) ]. Intervention: St. Johns Wort, rifampin: Avoid concomitant use with Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules [see Warnings and Precautions 5.9)] Ritonavir-containing products: see prescribing information for specific drugs. CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Increased exposure of omeprazole [see l n cal Pharmacology 12.3)] Intervention: Voriconazole: Dose adjustment of Omeprazole Delayed-Release Capsules is not normally required. However, in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, who may require higher doses, dose adjustment may be considered. See prescribing information for voriconazole. Decreased exposure of some antiretroviral drugs (e.g., rilpivirine, atazanavir and nelfinavir) when used concomitantly with omeprazole may reduce antiviral effect and promote the development of drug resistance [see li i cal harmacology 12.3)] . Increased exposure of other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., saquinavir) when used concomitantly with omeprazole may increase toxicity [see l n cal harmacology 12.3)] . There are other antiretroviral drugs which do not result in clinically relevant interactions with omeprazole.

28585020,"8.1 Pregnancy. Risk SummaryRaloxifene hydrochloride is contraindicated for use in pregnant women, and is not indicated for use in females of reproductive potential. Based on mechanism of action, raloxifene hydrochloride may block the important functions that estrogen has during all stages of pregnancy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Limited data with raloxifene hydrochloride use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform any drug associated risks for births defects or miscarriage.In rabbits and rats dosed during organogenesis or during gestation and lactation, raloxifene hydrochloride produced multiple adverse reproductive and developmental effects, including abortion; fetal anomalies; and delayed or disrupted parturition leading to maternal and neonatal mortality, at doses less than or similar to the maximum recommended human dose(based on human body surface area comparison).DataAnimal DataIn the developmental and reproductive toxicity studies conducted with raloxifene hydrochloride, numerous adverse effects were observed in multiple animal species. In rabbits dosed during organogenesis, abortion and low rate of fetal heart anomalies (ventricular septal defects) occurred at doses >=0.1 mg/kg (>=0.04 times the human dose based on surface area, mg/m2). In rats dosed during organogenesis, retardation of fetal growth and developmental abnormalities (wavy ribs, kidney cavitation) occurred at doses >=1 mg/kg (>=0.2 times the human dose based on surface area, mg/m2). Treatment of rats during gestation and lactation with doses of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg (0.02 to 1.6 times the human dose based on surface area, mg/m2) produced effects that included delayed and disrupted parturition, decreased neonatal survival and altered physical development, sex- and age-specific reductions in growth and changes in pituitary hormone content, and decreased lymphoid compartment size in offspring. At 10 mg/kg, the disruption of parturition resulted in maternal and progeny morbidity and death. Effects in adult offspring (4 months of age) included uterine hypoplasia and reduced fertility; however, no ovarian or vaginal pathology was observed.",e8b6cbe0-c1f4-4678-b852-f629a7f6a1b5,42228-7,PREGNANCY SECTION

The safety and effectiveness of risedronate was assessed in one-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 143 pediatric patients (94 received risedronate) with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). The enrolled population was predominantly patients with mild osteogenesis imperfecta (85% Type-I), aged to less than 16 years, 50% male and 82% Caucasian, with mean lumbar spine BMD Z-score of -2.08 (2.08 standard deviations below the mean for age-matched controls). Patients received either 2.5 mg (less than or equal to 30 kg body weight) or mg (greater than 30 kg body weight) daily oral dose. After one year, an increase in lumbar spine BMD in the risedronate group compared to the placebo group was observed. However, treatment with risedronate did not result in reduction in the risk of fracture in pediatric patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. In risedronate-treated subjects, no mineralization defects were noted in paired bone biopsy specimens obtained at baseline and month 12. The overall safety profile of risedronate in OI patients treated for up to 12 months was generally similar to that of adults with osteoporosis. However, there was an increased incidence of vomiting compared to placebo. In this study, vomiting was observed in 15% of children treated with risedronate and 6% of patients treated with placebo.

These cases had subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. In glyburide and metformin hydrochloride treated patients with diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue glyburide and metformin hydrochloride and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patients renal function include (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY): Before initiating glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 2 (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Initiation of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 2 Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patient taking glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. In patients taking glyburide and metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. Drug interactions The concomitant use of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater- The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patients age because elderly patients have greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. Radiologic studies with contrast Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop glyburide and metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 2; in patients with history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure, or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Reevaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart glyburide and metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable. Surgery and other procedures Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic states Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. Excessive Alcohol intake Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients, therefore, should be warned against excessive alcohol intake, acute or chronic, while receiving glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. Hepatic impairment Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Hypoglycemia Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride is capable of producing hypoglycemia or hypoglycemic symptoms, therefore, proper patient selection, dosing, and instructions are important to avoid potential hypoglycemic episodes. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents or ethanol. Renal or hepatic insufficiency may cause elevated drug levels of both glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, and the hepatic insufficiency may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of hypoglycemic reactions. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly and people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.. Before initiating glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 2 (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Initiation of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 2 . Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patient taking glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. In patients taking glyburide and metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. Drug interactions The concomitant use of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater- The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patients age because elderly patients have greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. Radiologic studies with contrast Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop glyburide and metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 2; in patients with history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure, or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Reevaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart glyburide and metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable. Surgery and other procedures Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic states Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. Excessive Alcohol intake Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients, therefore, should be warned against excessive alcohol intake, acute or chronic, while receiving glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. Hepatic impairment Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Glyburide. Hemolytic anemiaTreatment of patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to hemolytic anemia. Because glyburide and metformin hydrochloride belongs to the class of sulfonylurea agents, caution should be used in patients with G6PD deficiency and non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered. In postmarketing reports, hemolytic anemia has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency. Metformin Hydrochloride. Vitamin 12 levels In controlled clinical trials with metformin of 29 weeks duration, decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin 12, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with 12 absorption from the 12-intrinsic factor complex is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin 12 supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on metformin and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests). Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin 12 levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin 12 measurements at 2- to 3-year intervals may be useful. Macrovascular Outcomes. There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride or any other antidiabetic drug. Addition of Thiazolidinediones to Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride Therapy. HypoglycemiaPatients receiving glyburide and metformin hydrochloride in combination with thiazolidinedione may be at risk for hypoglycemia.Weight gainWeight gain was seen with the addition of rosiglitazone to glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, similar to that reported for thiazolidinedione therapy alone.Hepatic effectsWhen thiazolidinedione is used in combination with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, periodic monitoring of liver function tests should be performed in compliance with the labeled recommendations for the thiazolidinedione.. Information for Patients. Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride. Patients should be informed of the potential risks and benefits of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride and alternative modes of therapy. They should also be informed about the importance of adherence to dietary instructions; regular exercise program; and regular testing of blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, renal function, and hematologic parameters.The risks of lactic acidosis associated with metformin therapy, its symptoms, and conditions that predispose to its development, as noted in the WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS sections, should be explained to patients. Patients should be advised to discontinue glyburide and metformin hydrochloride immediately and promptly notify their health practitioner if unexplained hyperventilation, myalgia, malaise, unusual somnolence, or other nonspecific symptoms occur. Once patient is stabilized on any dose level of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of metformin therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. The risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be explained to patients and responsible family members.Patients should be counseled against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, while receiving glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. (See Patient Information printed below.) Laboratory Tests. Periodic fasting blood glucose (FBG) and HbA 1c measurements should be performed to monitor therapeutic response. Initial and periodic monitoring of hematologic parameters (e.g., hemoglobin/hematocrit and red blood cell indices) and renal function (serum creatinine) should be performed, at least on an annual basis. While megaloblastic anemia has rarely been seen with metformin therapy, if this is suspected, vitamin 12 deficiency should be excluded. Instruct patients to inform their doctor that they are taking glyburide and metformin hydrochloride prior to any surgical or radiological procedure, as temporary discontinuation of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride may be required until renal function has been confirmed to be normal (see PRECAUTIONS). Drug Interactions. Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride. Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of blood glucose control. These drugs include thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to patient receiving glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from patient receiving glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid as compared to sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins.. Glyburide. The hypoglycemic action of sulfonylureas may be potentiated by certain drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta-adrenergic blocking agents. When such drugs are administered to patient receiving glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia. When such drugs are withdrawn from patient receiving glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, the patient should be observed closely for loss of blood glucose control. An increased risk of liver enzyme elevations was observed in patients receiving glyburide concomitantly with bosentan. Therefore concomitant administration of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride and bosentan is contraindicated. possible interaction between glyburide and ciprofloxacin, fluoroquinolone antibiotic, has been reported, resulting in potentiation of the hypoglycemic action of glyburide. The mechanism for this interaction is not known. potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic agents leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported. Whether this interaction also occurs with the intravenous, topical, or vaginal preparations of miconazole is not known. Colesevelam: Concomitant administration of colesevelam and glyburide resulted in reductions in glyburide AUC and max of 32% and 47%, respectively. The reductions in glyburide AUC and max were 20% and 15%, respectively, when administered hour before, and not significantly changed (-7% and 4%, respectively) when administered hours before colesevelam. Metformin Hydrochloride. FurosemideA single-dose, metformin-furosemide drug interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated that pharmacokinetic parameters of both compounds were affected by coadministration. Furosemide increased the metformin plasma and blood max by 22% and blood AUC by 15%, without any significant change in metformin renal clearance. When administered with metformin, the max and AUC of furosemide were 31% and 12% smaller, respectively, than when administered alone, and the terminal half-life was decreased by 32%, without any significant change in furosemide renal clearance. No information is available about the interaction of metformin and furosemide when coadministered chronically. NifedipineA single-dose, metformin-nifedipine drug interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that coadministration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin max and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount excreted in the urine. max and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Metformin had minimal effects on nifedipine. Drugs that reduce metformin clearance Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transport-2 [OCT2] multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the accumulation of metformin and the risk for lactic acidosis. Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use. Such interaction between metformin and oral cimetidine has been observed in normal healthy volunteers in both single- and multiple-dose, metformin-cimetidine drug interaction studies, with 60% increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and 40% increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC. There was no change in elimination half-life in the single-dose study. Metformin had no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics. In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of metformin and propranolol, and metformin and ibuprofen were not affected when coadministered in single-dose interaction studies. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid, as compared to the sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins. Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Topiramate or other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) frequently causes decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients. Alcohol Alcohol is known to potentiate the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility. No animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. The following data are based on findings in studies performed with the individual products.. Glyburide. Studies in rats with glyburide alone at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 145 times the maximum recommended human daily [MRHD] dose of 20 mg for the glyburide component of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride based on body surface area comparisons) for 18 months revealed no carcinogenic effects. In 2-year oncogenicity study of glyburide in mice, there was no evidence of treatment-related tumors. There was no evidence of mutagenic potential of glyburide alone in the following in vitro tests: Salmonella microsome test (Ames test) and in the DNA damage/alkaline elution assay. Metformin Hydrochloride. Long-term carcinogenicity studies were performed with metformin alone in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately times the MRHD dose of 2000 mg of the metformin component of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin alone was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin alone in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day of metformin alone. There was no evidence of mutagenic potential of metformin alone in the following in vitro tests: Ames test S. typhimurium), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative. Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin alone when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately times the MRHD dose of the metformin component of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride based on body surface area comparisons. Pregnancy. Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category Recent information strongly suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with higher incidence of congenital abnormalities. Most experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose as close to normal as possible. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly needed. (See below.) There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride or its individual components. No animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. The following data are based on findings in studies performed with the individual products. Glyburide Reproduction studies were performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 500 times the MRHD dose of 20 mg of the glyburide component of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride based on body surface area comparisons and revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to glyburide. Metformin Hydrochloride Metformin alone was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of about and times the MRHD dose of 2000 mg of the metformin component of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated partial placental barrier to metformin. Nonteratogenic Effects. Prolonged severe hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days) has been reported in neonates born to mothers who were receiving sulfonylurea drug at the time of delivery. This has been reported more frequently with the use of agents with prolonged half-lives. It is not recommended that glyburide and metformin hydrochloride be used during pregnancy. However, if it is used, glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be discontinued at least weeks before the expected delivery date. (See Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. . Nursing Mothers. Although it is not known whether glyburide is excreted in human milk, some sulfonylurea drugs are known to be excreted in human milk. Studies in lactating rats show that metformin is excreted into milk and reaches levels comparable to those in plasma. Similar studies have not been conducted in nursing mothers. Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist, decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. If glyburide and metformin hydrochloride is discontinued, and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered.. Pediatric Use. The safety and efficacy of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride were evaluated in an active-controlled, double-blind, 26-week randomized trial involving total of 167 pediatric patients (ranging from to 16 years of age) with type diabetes. Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride was not shown statistically to be superior to either metformin or glyburide with respect to reducing HbA 1c from baseline (see Table 5). No unexpected safety findings were associated with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride in this trial. Table 5: HbA 1c (Percent) Change From Baseline at 26 Weeks: Pediatric Study Glyburide 2.5 mg Tablets Metformin 500 mg Tablets Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride 1.25 mg/250 mg Tablets Mean Final Dose 6.5 mg 1500 mg 3.1 mg/623 mg Hemoglobin 1c N=49 N=54 N=57 Baseline Mean (%) 7.7 7.99 7.85 Mean Change from Baseline -0.96 -0.48 -0.8 Difference from Metformin Difference from Glyburide -0.32 +0.16 Geriatric Use. Of the 642 patients who received glyburide and metformin hydrochloride in double-blind clinical studies, 23.8% were 65 and older while 2.8% were 75 and older. Of the 1302 patients who received glyburide and metformin hydrochloride in open-label clinical studies, 20.7% were 65 and older while 2.5% were 75 and older. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients (see also WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).",8593bf5a-2bb1-7a8a-e053-2a91aa0ad646,42232-9,PRECAUTIONS SECTION

28686048,"8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS. Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1). 8.1 Pregnancy. Risk SummaryData from prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine.. Clinical Considerations. Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy.. Data. Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than infants in this group.In study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity.. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities.The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively.Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was decrease in pup survival. The highest noeffect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day.. 8.2 Lactation. Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production.The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mothers clinical need for sumatriptan injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition.. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan injection.. DataFollowing subcutaneous administration of 6-mg dose of sumatriptan injection in lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk.. 8.4 Pediatric Use. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. sumatriptan injection is not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age.Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 pediatric migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults.Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled total of 701 pediatric migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older pediatric patients.Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. myocardial infarction has been reported in 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available.. 8.5 Geriatric Use. Clinical trials of sumatriptan injection did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].",f42c6e00-e693-48f3-8e84-c3f139e1adf5,43684-0,USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS SECTION

27921155,"Pregnancy. Pregnancy Category In animal reproduction studies, citalopram has been shown to have adverse effects on embryo/fetal and postnatal development, including teratogenic effects, when administered at doses greater than human therapeutic doses. In two rat embryo/fetal development studies, oral administration of citalopram (32, 56, or 112 mg/kg/day) to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects) at the high dose, which is approximately 18 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day on body surface area (mg/m2) basis. This dose was also associated with maternal toxicity (clinical signs, decreased body weight gain). The developmental, no-effect dose of 56 mg/kg/day is approximately times the MRHD on mg/m2 basis. In rabbit study, no adverse effects on embryo/fetal development were observed at doses of up to 16 mg/kg/day, or approximately times the MRHD on mg/m2 basis. Thus, teratogenic effects were observed at maternally toxic dose in the rat and were not observed in the rabbit. When female rats were treated with citalopram (4.8, 12.8, or 32 mg/kg/day) from late gestation through weaning, increased offspring mortality during the first days after birth and persistent offspring growth retardation were observed at the highest dose, which is approximately times the MRHD on mg/m2 basis. The no-effect dose of 12.8 mg/kg/day is approximately times the MRHD on mg/m2 basis. Similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses >= 24 mg/kg/day, approximately times the MRHD on mg/m2 basis. no-effect dose was not determined in that study. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, citalopram should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.. Nonteratogenic Effects. Neonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS). Infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1--2 per 1000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In retrospective, case-control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There is currently no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy; this is the first study that has investigated the potential risk. The study did not include enough cases with exposure to individual SSRIs to determine if all SSRIs posed similar levels of PPHN risk. When treating pregnant woman with citalopram during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Physicians should note that in prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication.",793c9089-8139-4d21-9e8c-64eb0d554063,42228-7,PREGNANCY SECTION

The adverse reaction profiles for pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension and pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets are similar. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.. Adults. Safety in nine randomized comparative U.S. clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another PPI, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3.

Pediatric Patients. Safety of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets in the treatment of EE associated with GERD was evaluated in pediatric patients ages year through 16 years in three clinical trials. Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (>4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain.For safety information in patients less than year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4). Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients in clinical trials with frequency of <=4% are listed below by body system:Body as Whole: allergic reaction, facial edemaGastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nauseaMetabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase)Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgiaNervous: dizziness, vertigoSkin and Appendages: urticariaThe following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision.. Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome. In clinical studies of ZE Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD.. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets.

28248420,"PRECAUTIONS. Development of Drug-resistant BacteriaPrescribing ceftriaxone in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Prolonged use of ceftriaxone may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.Patients with Renal or Hepatic ImpairmentCeftriaxone is excreted via both biliary and renal excretion (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Therefore, patients with renal failure normally require no adjustment in dosage when usual doses of ceftriaxone are administered.Dosage adjustments should not be necessary in patients with hepatic dysfunction; however, in patients with both hepatic dysfunction and significant renal disease, caution should be exercised and the ceftriaxone dosage should not exceed g daily.Ceftriaxone is not removed by peritoneal- or hemodialysis. In patients undergoing dialysis no additional supplementary dosing is required following the dialysis. In patients with both severe renal and hepatic dysfunction, close clinical monitoring for safety and efficacy is advised.Effect on Prothrombin TimeAlterations in prothrombin times have occurred in patients treated with ceftriaxone. Monitor prothrombin time during ceftriaxone treatment in patients with impaired vitamin synthesis or low vitamin stores (e.g., chronic hepatic disease and malnutrition). Vitamin administration (10 mg weekly) may be necessary if the prothrombin time is prolonged before or during therapy.Concomitant use of ceftriaxone with Vitamin antagonists may increase the risk of bleeding. Coagulation parameters should be monitored frequently, and the dose of the anticoagulant adjusted accordingly, both during and after treatment with ceftriaxone (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).Gallbladder PseudolithiasisCeftriaxone-calcium precipitates in the gallbladder have been observed in patients receiving ceftriaxone. These precipitates appear on sonography as an echo without acoustical shadowing suggesting sludge or as an echo with acoustical shadowing which may be misinterpreted as gallstones. The probability of such precipitates appears to be greatest in pediatric patients. Patients may be asymptomatic or may develop symptoms of gallbladder disease. The condition appears to be reversible upon discontinuation of ceftriaxone sodium and institution of conservative management. Discontinue ceftriaxone sodium in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of gallbladder disease and/or the sonographic findings described above.Urolithiasis and Post-Renal Acute Renal FailureCeftriaxone-calcium precipitates in the urinary tract have been observed in patients receiving ceftriaxone and may be detected as sonographic abnormalities. The probability of such precipitates appears to be greatest in pediatric patients. Patients may be asymptomatic or may develop symptoms of urolithiasis, and ureteral obstruction and post-renal acute renal failure. The condition appears to be reversible upon discontinuation of ceftriaxone sodium and institution of appropriate management. Ensure adequate hydration in patients receiving ceftriaxone. Discontinue ceftriaxone in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of urolithiasis, oliguria or renal failure and/or the sonographic findings described above.PancreatitisCases of pancreatitis, possibly secondary to biliary obstruction, have been reported in patients treated with ceftriaxone. Most patients presented with risk factors for biliary stasis and biliary sludge (preceding major therapy, severe illness, total parenteral nutrition). cofactor role of ceftriaxone-related biliary precipitation cannot be ruled out.. Information for Patients. oPatients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ceftriaxone for injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., common cold).oWhen ceftriaxone for injection is prescribed to treat bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ceftriaxone for injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future.oDiarrhea is common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.. oPatients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ceftriaxone for injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections.

If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility. Carcinogenesis. Considering the maximum duration of treatment and the class of the compound, carcinogenicity studies with ceftriaxone in animals have not been performed. The maximum duration of animal toxicity studies was months.. Mutagenesis. Genetic toxicology tests included the Ames test, micronucleus test and test for chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes cultured in vitro with ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone showed no potential for mutagenic activity in these studies.. Impairment of Fertility. Ceftriaxone produced no impairment of fertility when given intravenously to rats at daily doses up to 586 mg/kg/day, approximately 20 times the recommended clinical dose of g/day.. Pregnancy. Teratogenic Effects. Reproductive studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 20 times the usual human dose and have no evidence of embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity or teratogenicity. In primates, no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was demonstrated at dose approximately times the human dose.There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.. Nonteratogenic Effects. In rats, in the Segment (fertility and general reproduction) and Segment III (perinatal and postnatal) studies with intravenously administered ceftriaxone, no adverse effects were noted on various reproductive parameters during gestation and lactation, including postnatal growth, functional behavior and reproductive ability of the offspring, at doses of 586 mg/kg/day or less.. Nursing Mothers. Low concentrations of ceftriaxone are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when ceftriaxone is administered to nursing woman.. Pediatric Use. Safety and effectiveness of ceftriaxone in neonates, infants and pediatric patients have been established for the dosages described in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. In vitro studies have shown that ceftriaxone, like some other cephalosporins, can displace bilirubin from serum albumin. Ceftriaxone should not be administered to hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).. Geriatric Use. Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of ceftriaxone, 32% were 60 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.The pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone were only minimally altered in geriatric patients compared to healthy adult subjects and dosage adjustments are not necessary for geriatric patients with ceftriaxone dosages up to grams per day provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).. Influence on Diagnostic Tests. In patients treated with ceftriaxone the Coombs test may become positive. Ceftriaxone for injection, like other antibacterial drugs, may result in positive test results for galactosemia.Nonenzymatic methods for the glucose determination in urine may give false-positive results. For this reason, urine-glucose determination during therapy with ceftriaxone should be done enzymatically.The presence of ceftriaxone may falsely lower estimated blood glucose values obtained with some blood glucose monitoring systems. Please refer to instructions for use for each system. Alternative testing methods should be used if necessary.",de028434-46cf-44f6-8ac6-889c7c6943b3,42232-9,PRECAUTIONS SECTION

Granisetron has been evaluated in pediatric patient clinical trial for use in the prevention of PONV. Due to the lack of efficacy and the QT prolongation observed in this trial, use of granisetron for the prevention of PONV in children is not recommended. The trial was prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial that evaluated 157 children aged to 16 years who were undergoing elective surgery for tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. The purpose of the trial was to assess two dose levels (20 mcg/kg and 40 mcg/kg) of intravenous granisetron in the prevention of PONV. There was no active comparator or placebo. The primary endpoint was total control of nausea and vomiting (defined as no nausea, vomiting/retching, or use of rescue medication) in the 24 hours following surgery. Efficacy was not established due to lack of dose response.The trial also included standard 12 lead ECGs performed pre-dose and after the induction of anesthesia. ECGs were repeated at the end of surgery after the administration of granisetron and just prior to reversal of anesthesia. QT prolongation was seen at both dose levels. Five patients in this trial experienced an increase of >= 60 msec in QTcF. In addition, there were two patients whose QTcF was >= 500 msec. Interpretation of the QTcF prolongation was confounded by multiple factors, including the use of concomitant medication and the lack of either placebo or active control. thorough QT trial in adults has not been performed.Other adverse events that occurred in the study included: vomiting (5 to 8%), post-procedural hemorrhage (3 to 5%), and dehydration (0 to 5%).Pediatric patients under years of age have not been studied.",cb583779-2746-4363-9cf7-f198247188d1,34081-0,PEDIATRIC USE SECTION

Assess hepatic function enzymes prior to initiation of Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets, monthly for the first months, every 2-3 months for the remainder of the first year, and periodically thereafter. Use Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have history of liver disease. (5.1)Neuropsychiatric Events: Neuropsychiatric events, including sleep disorders and behavior changes, may occur with Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets. Instruct patients to be alert for neuropsychiatric events. Evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets if such events occur. (5.2). 5.1 Hepatotoxicity. Elevations of one or more hepatic function enzymes and bilirubin may occur during Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets therapy. These laboratory abnormalities may progress to clinically significant liver injury, remain unchanged, or resolve with continued treatment, usually within three weeks. The ALT (SGPT) test is considered the most sensitive indicator of liver injury for Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets. Assess hepatic function enzymes prior to initiation of, and during therapy with, Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets. Assess serum ALT before treatment begins, once month for the first months, every 2-3 months for the remainder of the first year, and periodically thereafter for patients receiving long-term Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets therapy. If clinical signs and/or symptoms of liver dysfunction develop (e.g., right upper quadrant pain, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, or flu-like symptoms) or transaminase elevations >=5xULN occur, discontinue Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets and follow hepatic function enzymes until normal.In controlled and open-label clinical studies involving more than 5000 patients treated with zileuton immediate-release tablets, the overall rate of ALT elevation >=3xULN was 3.2%. In these trials, one patient developed symptomatic hepatitis with jaundice, which resolved upon discontinuation of therapy. An additional patients with transaminase elevations developed mild hyperbilirubinemia that was less than 3xULN. There was no evidence of hypersensitivity or other alternative etiologies for these findings.Since treatment with Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets may result in increased hepatic function enzymes and liver injury, Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have past history of liver disease.. 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Events. Neuropsychiatric events have been reported in adult and adolescent patients taking zileuton, the active ingredient in Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets and zileuton immediate-release tablets. Post-marketing reports with zileuton include sleep disorders and behavior changes. The clinical details of some post-marketing reports involving zileuton appear consistent with drug-induced effect. Patient and prescribers should be alert for neuropsychiatric events. Patients should be instructed to notify their prescriber if these changes occur. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with Zileuton Extended-Release Tablets if such events occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)].",eac21801-4b9b-41bc-a37d-e30d43639d5e,43685-7,WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION

Use of Clobetasol Propionate Shampoo, 0.05%, in patients under 18 years old is not recommended due to potential for HPA axis suppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] The effect of Clobetasol Propionate Shampoo, 0.05%, on HPA axis suppression was evaluated in one trial in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis with involvement of at least 25% of the scalp. In this trial, of 12 evaluable subjects developed suppression of their HPA axis following weeks of treatment with Clobetasol Propionate Shampoo, 0.05%, applied once daily for 15 minutes to dry scalp before lathering and rinsing. Only of the subjects who had suppression was tested for recovery of HPA axis, and this subject recovered after weeks. No studies have been performed in patients under the age of 12. Because of higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression and Cushings syndrome when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of adrenal insufficiency during and/or after withdrawal of treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. Therefore, use is not recommended in patients under the age of 18. HPA axis suppression, Cushings syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids.

28195412,"8.1 Pregnancy. Risk SummaryThere are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of ZOMIG in pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of zolmitriptan to pregnant animals resulted in embryolethality and fetal abnormalities (malformations and variations) at clinically relevant exposures (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated rates of major birth defects (2.2%-2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal RiskPublished data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Animal Data When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 100, 400, and 1200 mg/kg/day (plasma exposures (AUCs) 280, 1100, and 5000 times the human AUC at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 10 mg/day), there was dose-related increase in embryolethality. no-effect dose for embryolethality was not established. When zolmitriptan was administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs 1, 11, and 42 times the human AUC at the MRHD), there were increases in embryolethality and in fetal malformations and variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development was associated with plasma AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD. When female rats were given zolmitriptan during gestation, parturition, and lactation at oral doses of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs 70, 280, and 1100 times that in human at the MRHD), an increased incidence of hydronephrosis was found in the offspring. The no-effect dose was associated with plasma AUC 280 times that in humans at the MRHD.",84b51cb9-83f3-4a49-7fa3-1adc0f963658,42228-7,PREGNANCY SECTION

The assay had lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 25 IU per mL. Sustained virologic response (SVR12) was the primary endpoint which was defined as HCV RNA less than LLOQ at 12 weeks after the end of treatment.. HCV/HIV-1 coinfected TN (GT1). HCV/HIV-1 coinfected TN or previous interferon relapsers or nonresponders (GT2 or 3). 14.2Clinical Trials in Subjects with Genotype or HCV. Treatment-Naive Adults NEUTRINO (Study 110)NEUTRINO was an open-label, single-arm trial that evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with SOVALDI in combination with peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin in treatment-naive subjects with genotype 1, 4, or HCV infection compared to pre-specified historical control.Treated subjects (N=327) had median age of 54 years (range: 19 to 70); 64% of the subjects were male; 79% were White, 17% were Black; 14% were Hispanic or Latino; mean body mass index was 29 kg/m2 (range: 18 to 56 kg/m2); 78% had baseline HCV RNA greater than log10 IU per mL; 17% had cirrhosis; 89% had HCV genotype 1; 9% had HCV genotype and 2% had HCV genotype or 6. Table 12 presents the SVR12 for the treatment group of SOVALDI peginterferon alfa ribavirin in subjects with genotype or HCV. Available data on subjects with genotype or HCV treated with SOVALDI peginterferon alfa ribavirin for 12 weeks were insufficient for dosing recommendations; therefore these results are not presented in Table 12 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.10)].Table 12Study NEUTRINO: SVR12 for Treatment-Naive Subjects with Genotype or HCVSOVALDI Peg-IFN alfa RBV 12 weeksN=320Overall SVR90% (289/320) Genotype 1One subject had genotype 1a/1b mixed infection. 90% (262/292) Genotype 1a92% (206/225) Genotype 1b83% (55/66) Genotype 496% (27/28)Outcome for subjects without SVR On-treatment virologic failure0/320 RelapseThe denominator for relapse is the number of subjects with HCV RNA <LLOQ at their last on-treatment assessment. 9% (28/319) OtherOther includes subjects who did not achieve SVR and did not meet virologic failure criteria (e.g., lost to follow-up). 1% (3/320)SVR12 for selected subgroups are presented in Table 13.Table 13SVR12 Rates for Selected Subgroups in NEUTRINO in Subjects with Genotype or HCVSOVALDI Peg-IFN alfa RBV 12 weeksCirrhosis No93% (247/267) Yes79% (42/53)Race Black87% (47/54) Non-black91% (242/266)Multiple Baseline Factors Genotype 1, Metavir F3/F4 fibrosis, IL28B non-C/C, HCV RNA >800,000 IU/mL71% (37/52)SVR12 rates were 99% (89/90) in subjects with genotype or HCV and baseline IL28B C/C allele and 87% (200/230) in subjects with genotype or HCV and baseline IL28B non-C/C alleles.It is estimated that the SVR12 in patients who previously failed pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy will approximate the observed SVR12 in NEUTRINO subjects with multiple baseline factors traditionally associated with lower response to interferon-based treatment (Table 13).The SVR12 rate in the NEUTRINO trial in genotype subjects with IL28B non-C/C alleles, HCV RNA greater than 800,000 IU/mL and Metavir F3/F4 fibrosis was 71% (37/52). 14.3Clinical Trials in Subjects with Genotype or HCV. Treatment-Naive Adults FISSION (Study 1231)FISSION was randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial that evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with SOVALDI and ribavirin compared to 24 weeks of treatment with peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin in treatment-naive subjects with genotype and HCV. The ribavirin dosage used in the SOVALDI ribavirin and peginterferon alfa 2a ribavirin arms were weight-based 1000-1200 mg per day and 800 mg per day regardless of weight, respectively. Subjects were randomized in 1:1 ratio and stratified by cirrhosis (presence vs. absence), HCV genotype (2 vs. 3) and baseline HCV RNA level (less than log10 IU/mL vs. at least log10 IU/mL). Subjects with genotype or HCV were enrolled in an approximately 1:3 ratio.Treated subjects (N=499) had median age of 50 years (range: 19 to 77); 66% of the subjects were male; 87% were White, 3% were Black; 14% were Hispanic or Latino; mean body mass index was 28 kg/m2 (range: 17 to 52 kg/m2); 57% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than log10 IU per mL; 20% had cirrhosis; 72% had HCV genotype 3. Table 14 presents the SVR12 for the treatment groups of SOVALDI ribavirin and peginterferon alfa ribavirin in subjects with genotype HCV. SVR12 for genotype subjects treated with SOVALDI ribavirin for 12 weeks was suboptimal; therefore these results are not presented in Table 14.

Subjects were randomized in 3:1 ratio and stratified by cirrhosis (presence vs. absence).Treated subjects (N=278) had median age of 54 years (range: 21 to 75); 54% of the subjects were male; 91% were White, 5% were Black; 11% were Hispanic or Latino; mean body mass index was 28 kg/m2 (range: 18 to 53 kg/m2); 70% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than log10 IU per mL; 16% had cirrhosis; 49% had HCV genotype 3. The proportions of subjects who were interferon intolerant, ineligible, or unwilling were 9%, 44%, and 47%, respectively. Most subjects had no prior HCV treatment (81%). Table 16 presents the SVR12 for the treatment groups of SOVALDI ribavirin and placebo in subjects with genotype HCV.

Subjects were randomized in 1:1 ratio and stratified by cirrhosis (presence vs. absence) and HCV genotype (2 vs. 3).Treated subjects (N=201) had median age of 56 years (range: 24 to 70); 70% of the subjects were male; 87% were White; 3% were Black; 9% were Hispanic or Latino; mean body mass index was 29 kg/m2 (range: 19 to 44 kg/m2); 73% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than log10 IU per mL; 34% had cirrhosis; 63% had HCV genotype 3; 75% were prior relapsers. Table 18 presents the SVR12 for the treatment groups of SOVALDI ribavirin for 12 weeks in subjects with genotype HCV. Treatment of 16 weeks in subjects with genotype HCV was not shown to increase the SVR12 observed with 12 weeks of treatment.

Treatment-Naive and Previously Treated Adults VALENCE (Study 0133)The VALENCE trial evaluated SOVALDI in combination with weight-based ribavirin for the treatment of genotype or HCV infection in treatment-naive subjects or subjects who did not achieve SVR with prior interferon-based treatment, including subjects with compensated cirrhosis. The original trial design was 4 to randomization to SOVALDI ribavirin for 12 weeks or placebo. Based on emerging data, this trial was unblinded and all genotype HCV-infected subjects continued the original planned treatment and received SOVALDI ribavirin for 12 weeks, and duration of treatment with SOVALDI ribavirin in genotype HCV-infected subjects was extended to 24 weeks. Eleven genotype subjects had already completed SOVALDI ribavirin for 12 weeks at the time of the amendment.Treated subjects (N=419) had median age of 51 years (range: 19 to 74); 60% of the subjects were male; mean body mass index was 26 kg/m2 (range: 17 to 44 kg/m2); the mean baseline HCV RNA level was 6.4 log10 IU per mL; 78% had HCV genotype 3; 58% of the subjects were treatment-experienced and 65% of those subjects experienced relapse/breakthrough to prior HCV treatment.Table 20 presents the SVR12 for the treatment groups of SOVALDI ribavirin for 12 weeks and 24 weeks.Table 20Study VALENCEPlacebo subjects (N=85) were not included as none achieved SVR12.

SOVALDI was studied in an open-label clinical trial (Study PHOTON-1) evaluating the safety and efficacy of 12 or 24 weeks of treatment with SOVALDI and ribavirin in adult subjects with genotype 1, or chronic hepatitis coinfected with HIV-1. Genotype and subjects were either HCV treatment-naive or experienced, whereas genotype subjects were all treatment-naive. Subjects received 400 mg SOVALDI and weight-based ribavirin (1000 mg for subjects weighing less than 75 kg or 1200 mg for subjects weighing at least 75 kg) daily for 12 or 24 weeks based on genotype and prior treatment history. Subjects were either not on antiretroviral therapy with CD4+ cell count greater than 500 cells/mm3 or had virologically suppressed HIV-1 with CD4+ cell count greater than 200 cells/mm3. Efficacy data 12 weeks post treatment are available for 210 subjects (see Table 22).

SVR12 rates in subjects with HCV genotype infection were 80% (24/30) in subjects with baseline IL28B C/C allele and 75% (62/83) in subjects with baseline IL28B non-C/C alleles.In the 223 HCV subjects with HIV-1 coinfection, the percentage of CD4+ cells did not change during treatment. Median CD4+ cell count decreases of 85 cells/mm3 and 84 cells/mm3 were observed at the end of treatment with SOVALDI ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks, respectively. HIV-1 rebound during SOVALDI ribavirin treatment occurred in subjects (0.9%) on antiretroviral therapy.. 14.5Clinical Trial in Pediatrics (Study 1112). The efficacy of SOVALDI in HCV-infected pediatric subjects years of age and older was evaluated in 106 subjects with HCV genotype (N 31) or genotype (N 75) in Phase 2, open label clinical trial. Subjects with HCV genotype or infection in the trial were treated with SOVALDI and weight-based ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].. Subjects 12 Years to <18 Years of Age: SOVALDI was evaluated in 52 subjects12 years to <18 years of age with HCV genotype (N 13) or genotype (N 39) infection. The median age was 15 years (range: 12 to 17); 40% of the subjects were female; 90% were White, 4% were Black, and 2% were Asian; 4% were Hispanic/Latino; mean body mass index was 22 kg/m2 (range: 16 to 32 kg/m2);mean weight was 60 kg (range: 30 to 101 kg); 17% were treatment experienced; 65% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000 IU/mL; and no subjects had known cirrhosis. The majority of subjects (71%) had been infected through vertical transmission.The SVR12 rate was 100% [13/13] in genotype subjects and 97% [38/39] in genotype subjects. No subject experienced on-treatment virologic failure or relapse.. Subjects Years to <12 Years of Age: SOVALDI was evaluated in 41 subjects years to <12 years of age with HCV genotype (N 13) or genotype (N 28) infection. The median age was years (range: to 11); 73% of the subjects were female; 71% were White and 20% were Asian; 15% were Hispanic/Latino; mean body mass index was 19 kg/m2 (range: 13 to 32 kg/m2); mean weight was 34 kg (range 15 to 80 kg); 98% were treatment naive; 46% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000 IU/mL; and no subjects had known cirrhosis. The majority of subjects (98%) had been infected through vertical transmission.The SVR12 rate was 100% (13/13) in genotype and 100% (28/28) in genotype subjects.). No subjects experienced on-treatment virologic failure or relapse. Subjects Years to <6 Years of Age: SOVALDI was evaluated in 13 subjects years to <6 years of age with HCV genotype (N 5) or genotype (N 8) infection. The median age was years (range: to 5); 77% of the subjects were female; 69% were White, 8% were Black, and 8% were Asian; 8% were Hispanic/Latino; mean body mass index was 15 kg/m2 (range: 13 to 17 kg/m2); mean weight was 17 kg (range 13 to 19 kg); 100% were treatment naive; 23% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000 IU/mL; and no subjects had known cirrhosis. The majority of subjects (85%) had been infected through vertical transmission.The SVR12 rate was 80% (4/5) in genotype subjects and 100% (8/8) in genotype subjects. No subjects experienced on-treatment virologic failure or relapse.

Gallbladder surgery was also performed more frequently in the gemfibrozil group compared to the placebo group (1.9% versus 0.3%, p=0.07) in the secondary prevention component. statistically significant increase in appendectomy in the gemfibrozil group was seen also in the secondary prevention component (6 on gemfibrozil versus on placebo, p=0.014).Nervous system and special senses adverse reactions were more common in the gemfibrozil group. These included hypesthesia, paresthesias, and taste perversion. Other adverse reactions that were more common among gemfibrozil treatment group subjects but where causal relationship was not established include cataracts, peripheral vascular disease, and intracerebral hemorrhage.From other studies it seems probable that gemfibrozil is causally related to the occurrence of MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS (see WARNINGS), and to ABNORMAL LIVER FUNCTION TESTS and HEMATOLOGIC CHANGES (see PRECAUTIONS).Reports of viral and bacterial infections (common cold, cough, urinary tract infections) were more common in gemfibrozil treated patients in other controlled clinical trials of 805 patients.

28374613,"12.3 Pharmacokinetics. Absorption Ondansetron is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes some first-pass metabolism. Mean bioavailability in healthy subjects, following administration of single mg tablet, is approximately 56%. Ondansetron systemic exposure does not increase proportionately to dose. The area under curve (AUC) from 16 mg tablet was 24% greater than predicted from an mg tablet dose. This may reflect some reduction of first-pass metabolism at higher oral doses. Food Effects: Bioavailability is also slightly enhanced by the presence of food. Distribution Plasma protein binding of ondansetron as measured in vitro was 70% to 76% over the concentration range of 10 to 500 ng/mL. Circulating drug also distributes into erythrocytes. Elimination Metabolism and Excretion: Ondansetron is extensively metabolized in humans, with approximately 5% of radiolabeled dose recovered as the parent compound from the urine. The metabolites are observed in the urine. The primary metabolic pathway is hydroxylation on the indole ring followed by subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation. In vitro metabolism studies have shown that ondansetron is substrate for human hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. In terms of overall ondansetron turnover, CYP3A4 played the predominant role. Because of the multiplicity of metabolic enzymes capable of metabolizing ondansetron, it is likely that inhibition or loss of one enzyme (e.g., CYP2D6 genetic deficiency) will be compensated by others and may result in little change in overall rates of ondansetron elimination. Although some nonconjugated metabolites have pharmacologic activity, these are not found in plasma at concentrations likely to significantly contribute to the biological activity of ondansetron. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: reduction in clearance and increase in elimination half-life are seen in patients older than 75 years compared to younger subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] Sex: Gender differences were shown in the disposition of ondansetron given as single dose. The extent and rate of absorption are greater in women than men. Slower clearance in women, smaller apparent volume of distribution (adjusted for weight), and higher absolute bioavailability resulted in higher plasma ondansetron concentrations. These higher plasma concentrations may in part be explained by differences in body weight between men and women. It is not known whether these sex-related differences were clinically important. More detailed pharmacokinetic information is contained in Tables and 6.

However, the mean plasma clearance of ondansetron was reduced by about 50% in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). The reduction in clearance was variable and not consistent with an increase in half-life [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] Hepatic Impairment: In patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, clearance is reduced 2-fold and mean half-life is increased to 11.6 hours compared with 5.7 hours in healthy subjects. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 10 or greater), clearance is reduced 2-fold to 3-fold and apparent volume of distribution is increased with resultant increase in half-life to 20 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] Drug Interaction Studies CYP 3A4 Inducers: Ondansetron elimination may be affected by cytochrome P-450 inducers. In pharmacokinetic trial of 16 epileptic patients maintained chronically on CYP3A4 inducers, carbamazepine, or phenytoin, reduction in AUC, max, and 1/2 of ondansetron was observed. This resulted in significant increase in the clearance of ondansetron. However, this increase is not thought to be clinically relevant [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] Chemotherapeutic Agents: Carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron [see Drug Interactions (7.4)] Antacids: Concomitant administration of antacids does not alter the absorption of ondansetron.",77f6270f-af0b-f1fa-e053-2991aa0ab7e8,43682-4,PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION

28549371,"Pharmacokinetics. The behavior of the individual components is described below. HydrocodoneFollowing 10 mg oral dose of hydrocodone administered to five adult male subjects, the mean peak concentration was 23.6 +- 5.2 ng/mL. Maximum serum levels were achieved at 1.3 +- 0.3 hours and the half-life was determined to be 3.8 +- 0.3 hours. Hydrocodone exhibits complex pattern of metabolism including O-demethylation, N-demethylation and 6-keto reduction to the corresponding 6-- and 6--hydroxymetabolites. See OVERDOSAGE for toxicity information. CYP3A4 mediated N-demethylation to norhydrocodone is the primary metabolic pathway of hydrocodone with lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated O-demethylation to hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is formed from the O-demethylation of hydrocodone and may contribute to the total analgesic effect of hydrocodone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). N-demethylation of hydrocodone to form norhydrocodone via CYP3A4 while O-demethylation of hydrocodone to hydromorphone is predominantly catalyzed by CYP2D6 and to lesser extent by an unknown low affinity CYP enzyme. Hydrocodone and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in the kidneys. AcetaminophenAcetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed throughout most body tissues. small fraction (10 to 25%) of acetaminophen is bound to plasma proteins. The plasma half-life is 1.25 to hours, but may be increased by liver damage and following overdosage. Elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism (conjugation) and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites. Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver by first-order kinetics and involves three principal separate pathways: conjugation with glucuronide; conjugation with sulfate; and oxidation via the cytochrome, P450-dependent, mixed-function oxidase enzyme pathway to form reactive intermediate metabolite, which conjugates with glutathione and is then further metabolized to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates. The principal cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved appears to be CYP2E1, with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 as additional pathways. Approximately 85% of an oral dose appears in the urine within 24 hours of administration, most as the glucuronide conjugate, with small amounts of other conjugates and unchanged drug.

27971879,"PRECAUTIONS. General. Diltiazem hydrochloride is extensively metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys and in bile. As with any drug given over prolonged periods, laboratory parameters of renal and hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals. The drug should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. In subacute and chronic dog and rat studies designed to produce toxicity, high doses of diltiazem were associated with hepatic damage. In special subacute hepatic studies, oral doses of 125 mg/kg and higher in rats were associated with histological changes in the liver which were reversible when the drug was discontinued. In dogs, doses of 20 mg/kg were also associated with hepatic changes; however, these changes were reversible with continued dosing.Dermatological events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS) may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of diltiazem hydrochloride. However, skin eruptions progressing to erythema multiforme and/or exfoliative dermatitis have also been infrequently reported. Should dermatologic reaction persist, the drug should be discontinued.. Drug Interactions. Due to the potential for additive effects, caution and careful titration are warranted in patients receiving diltiazem concomitantly with other agents known to affect cardiac contractility and/or conduction (see WARNINGS). Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using beta-blockers or digitalis concomitantly with diltiazem (see WARNINGS).As with all drugs, care should be exercised when treating patients with multiple medications. Diltiazem is both substrate and an inhibitor of the cytochrome P-450 3A4 enzyme system. Other drugs that are specific substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of this enzyme system may have significant impact on the efficacy and side effect profile of diltiazem. Patients taking other drugs that are substrates of CYP450 3A4, especially patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment, may require dosage adjustment when starting or stopping concomitantly administered diltiazem in order to maintain optimum therapeutic blood levels.Anesthetics: The depression of cardiac contractility, conductivity, and automaticity as well as the vascular dilation associated with anesthetics may be potentiated by calcium channel blockers. When used concomitantly, anesthetics and calcium blockers should be titrated carefully.Benzodiazepines: Studies showed that diltiazem increased the AUC of midazolam and triazolam by 3- to 4-fold and the Cmax by 2-fold, compared to placebo. The elimination half-life of midazolam and triazolam also increased (1.5- to 2.5-fold) during coadministration with diltiazem. These pharmacokinetic effects seen during diltiazem coadministration can result in increased clinical effects (e.g., prolonged sedation) of both midazolam and triazolam.Beta-blockers: Controlled and uncontrolled domestic studies suggest that concomitant use of diltiazem hydrochloride and beta-blockers is usually well tolerated, but available data are not sufficient to predict the effects of concomitant treatment in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac conduction abnormalities.Administration of diltiazem hydrochloride concomitantly with propranolol in five normal volunteers resulted in increased propranolol levels in all subjects and bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately 50%. In vitro, propranolol appears to be displaced from its binding sites by diltiazem. If combination therapy is initiated or withdrawn in conjunction with propranolol, an adjustment in the propranolol dose may be warranted (see WARNINGS).Buspirone: In nine healthy subjects, diltiazem significantly increased the mean buspirone AUC 5.5-fold and Cmax 4.1-fold compared to placebo. The T1/2 and Tmax of buspirone were not significantly affected by diltiazem. Enhanced effects and increased toxicity of buspirone may be possible during concomitant administration with diltiazem. Subsequent dose adjustments may be necessary during coadministration, and should be based on clinical assessment.Carbamazepine: Concomitant administration of diltiazem with carbamazepine has been reported to result in elevated serum levels of carbamazepine (40% to 72% increase), resulting in toxicity in some cases. Patients receiving these drugs concurrently should be monitored for potential drug interaction.Cimetidine: study in six healthy volunteers has shown significant increase in peak diltiazem plasma levels (58%) and area-under-the-curve (53%) after 1-week course of cimetidine at 1200 mg per day and single dose of diltiazem 60 mg. Ranitidine produced smaller, nonsignificant increases. The effect may be mediated by cimetidines known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P-450, the enzyme system responsible for the first-pass metabolism of diltiazem. Patients currently receiving diltiazem therapy should be carefully monitored for change in pharmacological effect when initiating and discontinuing therapy with cimetidine. An adjustment in the diltiazem dose may be warranted.Clonidine: Sinus bradycardia resulting in hospitalization and pacemaker insertion has been reported in association with the use of clonidine concurrently with diltiazem. Monitor heart rate in patients receiving concomitant diltiazem and clonidine.Cyclosporine: pharmacokinetic interaction between diltiazem and cyclosporine has been observed during studies involving renal and cardiac transplant patients. In renal and cardiac transplant recipients, reduction of cyclosporine dose ranging from 15% to 48% was necessary to maintain cyclosporine trough concentrations similar to those seen prior to the addition of diltiazem. If these agents are to be administered concurrently, cyclosporine concentrations should be monitored, especially when diltiazem therapy is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued.The effect of cyclosporine on diltiazem plasma concentrations has not been evaluated.Digitalis: Administration of diltiazem hydrochloride with digoxin in 24 healthy male subjects increased plasma digoxin concentrations approximately 20%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in 12 patients with coronary artery disease. Since there have been conflicting results regarding the effect of digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing diltiazem hydrochloride therapy to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization (see WARNINGS).Quinidine: Diltiazem significantly increases the AUC (0 ->) of quinidine by 51%, T1/2 by 36%, and decreases its CLoral by 33%. Monitoring for quinidine adverse effects may be warranted and the dose adjusted accordingly.Rifampin: Coadministration of rifampin with diltiazem lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels. Coadministration of diltiazem with rifampin or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided when possible, and alternative therapy considered.Statins: Diltiazem is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and has been shown to increase significantly the AUC of some statins. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with statins metabolized by CYP3A4 may be increased with concomitant use of diltiazem. When possible, use non-CYP3A4-metabolized statin together with diltiazem; otherwise, dose adjustments for both diltiazem and the statin should be considered along with close monitoring for signs and symptoms of any statin related adverse events.In healthy volunteer cross-over study (N=10), coadministration of single 20 mg dose of simvastatin at the end of 14 day regimen with 120 mg BID diltiazem sustained-release resulted in 5-fold increase in mean simvastatin AUC versus simvastatin alone. Subjects with increased average steady-state exposures of diltiazem showed greater fold increase in simvastatin exposure. Computer-based simulations showed that at daily dose of 480 mg of diltiazem, an 8- to 9-fold mean increase in simvastatin AUC can be expected. If coadministration of simvastatin with diltiazem is required, limit the daily doses of simvastatin to 10 mg and diltiazem to 240 mg.In ten-subject randomized, open label, 4-way cross-over study, coadministration of diltiazem (120 mg BID diltiazem sustained-release for weeks) with single 20 mg dose of lovastatin resulted in 3- to 4-fold increase in mean lovastatin AUC and Cmax versus lovastatin alone. In the same study, there was no significant change in 20 mg single dose pravastatin AUC and Cmax during diltiazem coadministration. Diltiazem plasma levels were not significantly affected by lovastatin or pravastatin.. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility. 24-month study in rats at oral dosage levels of up to 100 mg/kg/day and 21-month study in mice at oral dosage levels of up to 30 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. There was also no mutagenic response in vitro or in vivo in mammalian cell assays or in vitro in bacteria. No evidence of impaired fertility was observed in study performed in male and female rats at oral dosages of up to 100 mg/kg/day.. Pregnancy. Category C. Reproduction studies have been conducted in mice, rats, and rabbits. Administration of doses ranging from five to ten times greater (on mg/kg basis) than the daily recommended therapeutic dose has resulted in embryo and fetal lethality. These doses, in some studies, have been reported to cause skeletal abnormalities. In the perinatal/postnatal studies, there was an increased incidence of stillbirths at doses of 20 times the human dose or greater.There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, use diltiazem in pregnant women only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.. Nursing Mothers. Diltiazem is excreted in human milk. One report suggests that concentrations in breast milk may approximate serum levels. If use of diltiazem is deemed essential, an alternative method of infant feeding should be instituted.. Pediatric Use. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.. Geriatric Use. Clinical studies of diltiazem did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",46eb53b9-89d4-4566-8e42-fb7d355eb052,42232-9,PRECAUTIONS SECTION
28420579,"Drug Interactions:. Effect of Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines and Opioids: The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites, and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation. Effect of Clonazepam on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs:Clonazepam does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine or phenobarbital. Clonazepam has the potential to influence concentrations of phenytoin. Monitoring of phenytoin concentration is recommended when clonazepam is co-administrated with phenytoin. The effect of clonazepam on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.. Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Clonazepam:Literature reports suggest that ranitidine, an agent that decreases stomach acidity, does not greatly alter clonazepam pharmacokinetics.In study in which the mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the max of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to when it was given alone. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors sertraline (weak CYP3A4 inducer) and fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), and the anti-epileptic drug felbamate (CYP2C19 inhibitor and CYP3A4 inducer) do not affect the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam. Cytochrome P450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital induce clonazepam metabolism, causing an approximately 38% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels. Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral antifungal agents (e.g., fluconazole), should be used cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam because they may impair the metabolism of clonazepam leading to exaggerated concentrations and effects.. Pharmacodynamic Interactions:The CNS-depressant action of the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be potentiated by alcohol, narcotics, barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, antianxiety agents, the phenothiazines, thioxanthene and butyrophenone classes of antipsychotic agents, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants, and by other anticonvulsant drugs.",2dc15db1-9dff-4be9-8e73-35a01c5aea32,34073-7,DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION

28936452,"5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS. o Life-threatening serious rash and/or rash-related death: Discontinue at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related. (Boxed Warning, 5.1) Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: Consider this diagnosis and evaluate patients immediately if they develop signs or symptoms of systemic inflammation. Discontinue lamotrigine if an alternative etiology is not established. 5.2) Fatal or life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction: Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, may be fatal or life threatening. Early signs may include rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy. These reactions may be associated with other organ involvement, such as hepatitis, hepatic failure, blood dyscrasias, or acute multiorgan failure. Lamotrigine should be discontinued if alternate etiology for this reaction is not found. 5.3) Cardiac rhythm and conduction abnormalities: Based on invitro findings, lamotrigine could cause serious arrhythmias and/or death in patients with certain underlying cardiac disorders or arrhythmias. Any expected or observed benefit of lamotrigine in an individual patient with clinically important structural or functional heart disease must be carefully weighed against the risk for serious arrythmias and/or death for that patient. 5.4) Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia): May occur, either with or without an associated hypersensitivity syndrome. Monitor for signs of anemia, unexpected infection, or bleeding. 5.5) Suicidal behavior and ideation: Monitor for suicidal thoughts or behaviors. 5.6) Aseptic meningitis: Monitor for signs of meningitis. 5.7) Medication errors due to product name confusion: Strongly advise patients to visually inspect tablets to verify the received drug is correct. 5.8, 16, 17) 5.1 Serious Skin Rashes [see Boxed Warning] Pediatric PopulationThe incidence of serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of lamotrigine in prospectively followed cohort of pediatric patients (aged to 17 years) is approximately 0.3% to 0.8%. One rash-related death was reported in prospectively followed cohort of 1,983 pediatric patients (aged to 16 years) with epilepsy taking lamotrigine tablets as adjunctive therapy. Additionally, there have been rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis with and without permanent sequelae and/or death in US and foreign postmarketing experience.;There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in pediatric patients. In pediatric patients who used valproate concomitantly for epilepsy, 1.2% (6 of 482) experienced serious rash compared with 0.6% (6 of 952) patients not taking valproate.Adult PopulationSerious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of lamotrigine occurred in 0.3% (11 of 3,348) of adult patients who received lamotrigine tablets in premarketing clinical trials of epilepsy. In the bipolar and other mood disorders clinical trials, the rate of serious rash was 0.08% (1 of 1,233) of adult patients who received lamotrigine tablets as initial monotherapy and 0.13% (2 of 1,538) of adult patients who received lamotrigine tablets as adjunctive therapy. No fatalities occurred among these individuals. However, in worldwide postmarketing experience, rare cases of rash-related death have been reported, but their numbers are too few to permit precise estimate of the rate. ;Among the rashes leading to hospitalization were Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, and those associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in adults. Specifically, of 584 patients administered lamotrigine tablets with valproate in epilepsy clinical trials, (1%) were hospitalized in association with rash; in contrast, (0.16%) of 2,398 clinical trial patients and volunteers administered lamotrigine tablets in the absence of valproate were hospitalized. ;Patients with History of Allergy or Rash to Other Antiepileptic DrugsThe risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation for lamotrigine tablets is exceeded and in patients with history of allergy or rash to other AEDs.. 5.2 Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has occurred in pediatric and adult patients taking lamotrigine for various indications. HLH is life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. It is associated with high mortality rates if not recognized early and treated. Common findings include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, neurologic symptoms, cytopenias, high serum ferritin, hypertriglyceridemia and liver function and coagulation abnormalities. In cases of HLH reported with lamotrigine, patients have presented with signs of systemic inflammation (fever, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and organ system dysfunction) and blood dyscrasias. Symptoms have been reported to occur within to 24 days following the initiation of treatment. Patients who develop early manifestations of pathologic immune activation should be evaluated immediately, and diagnosis of HLH should be considered. lamotrigine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.. 5.3 Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions and Organ Failure. Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have occurred with lamotrigine. Some have been fatal or life threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved.;Fatalities associated with acute multiorgan failure and various degrees of hepatic failure have been reported in of 3,796 adult patients and of 2,435 pediatric patients who received lamotrigine in epilepsy clinical trials. Rare fatalities from multiorgan failure have also been reported in postmarketing use.;Isolated liver failure without rash or involvement of other organs has also been reported with lamotrigine. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Lamotrigine tablets should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.;Prior to initiation of treatment with lamotrigine tablets, the patient should be instructed that rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may herald serious medical event and that the patient should report any such occurrence to healthcare provider immediately.. 5.4 Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities. In vitro testing showed that lamotrigine exhibits Class IB antiarrhythmic activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.2)] Based on theseinvitro findings, lamotrigine could slow ventricular conduction (widen QRS) and induce proarrhythmia, which can lead to sudden death, in patients with clinically important structural or functional heart disease (i.e., patients with heart failure, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, conduction system disease, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac channelopathies [e.g.,Brugada syndrome], clinically important ischemic heart disease, or multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease). Any expected or observed benefit of lamotrigine in an individual patient with clinically important structural or functional heart disease must be carefully weighed against the risks for serious arrythmias and/or death for that patient. Concomitant use of other sodium channel blockers may further increase the risk of proarrhythmia. 5.5 Blood Dyscrasias There have been reports of blood dyscrasias that may or may not be associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity (also known as DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions 5.3)] These have included neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and, rarely, aplastic anemia and pure red cell aplasia. 5.6 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation. AEDs, including lamotrigine tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ;Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared with 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. ;The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. ;The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanism of action and across range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. ;Table shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.Table 7. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled AnalysisIndicationPlacebo Patients with Events per 1,000 PatientsDrug Patients with Events per 1,000 PatientsRelative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo PatientsRisk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events per 1,000 PatientsEpilepsy1.03.43.52.4Psychiatric5.78.51.52.9Other1.01.81.90.9Total2.44.31.81.9The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. ;Anyone considering prescribing lamotrigine tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. ;Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, the emergence of suicidal thoughts or suicidal behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.. 5.7 Aseptic Meningitis Therapy with lamotrigine increases the risk of developing aseptic meningitis. Because of the potential for serious outcomes of untreated meningitis due to other causes, patients should also be evaluated for other causes of meningitis and treated as appropriate. Postmarketing cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported in pediatric and adult patients taking lamotrigine for various indications. Symptoms upon presentation have included headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and nuchal rigidity. Rash, photophobia, myalgia, chills, altered consciousness, and somnolence were also noted in some cases. Symptoms have been reported to occur within day to one and half months following the initiation of treatment. In most cases, symptoms were reported to resolve after discontinuation of lamotrigine. Re-exposure resulted in rapid return of symptoms (from within 30 minutes to day following re-initiation of treatment) that were frequently more severe. Some of the patients treated with lamotrigine who developed aseptic meningitis had underlying diagnoses of systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyzed at the time of clinical presentation in reported cases was characterized by mild to moderate pleocytosis, normal glucose levels, and mild to moderate increase in protein. CSF white blood cell count differentials showed predominance of neutrophils in majority of the cases, although predominance of lymphocytes was reported in approximately one third of the cases. Some patients also had new onset of signs and symptoms of involvement of other organs (predominantly hepatic and renal involvement), which may suggest that in these cases the aseptic meningitis observed was part of hypersensitivity reaction [see Warnings and Precautions 5.3)] . 5.8 Potential Medication Errors. Medication errors involving lamotrigine tablets have occurred. In particular, the name lamotrigine can be confused with the names of other commonly used medications. Medication errors may also occur between the different formulations of lamotrigine tablets. To reduce the potential of medication errors, write and say lamotrigine tablets clearly. Depictions of the lamotrigine tablets can be found in the Medication Guide that accompanies the product to highlight the distinctive markings, colors, and shapes that serve to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help reduce the risk of medication errors. To avoid the medication error of using the wrong drug or formulation, patients should be strongly advised to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are lamotrigine tablets, as well as the correct formulation of lamotrigine, each time they fill their prescription.. 5.9 Concomitant Use with Oral Contraceptives. Some estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to decrease serum concentrations of lamotrigine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Dosage adjustments will be necessary in most patients who start or stop estrogen-containing oral contraceptives while taking lamotrigine tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] During the week of inactive hormone preparation (pill-free week) of oral contraceptive therapy, plasma lamotrigine levels are expected to rise, as much as doubling at the end of the week. Adverse reactions consistent with elevated levels of lamotrigine, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia, could occur. 5.10 Withdrawal Seizures. As with other AEDs, lamotrigine tablets should not be abruptly discontinued. In patients with epilepsy there is possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In clinical trials in adults with bipolar disorder, patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine. Unless safety concerns require more rapid withdrawal, the dose of lamotrigine tablets should be tapered over period of at least weeks (approximately 50% reduction per week) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . 5.11 Status Epilepticus. Valid estimates of the incidence of treatment-emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with lamotrigine are difficult to obtain because reporters participating in clinical trials did not all employ identical rules for identifying cases. At minimum, of 2,343 adult patients had episodes that could unequivocally be described as status epilepticus. In addition, number of reports of variably defined episodes of seizure exacerbation (e.g., seizure clusters, seizure flurries) were made.. 5.12 Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). During the premarketing development of lamotrigine, 20 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among cohort of 4,700 patients with epilepsy (5,747 patient-years of exposure).;Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0035 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients not receiving lamotrigine (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of patients with epilepsy, to 0.004 for recently studied clinical trial population similar to that in the clinical development program for lamotrigine, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or suggest concern depends on the comparability of the populations reported upon with the cohort receiving lamotrigine and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Probably most reassuring is the similarity of estimated SUDEP rates in patients receiving lamotrigine tablets and those receiving other AEDs, chemically unrelated to each other, that underwent clinical testing in similar populations. Importantly, that drug is chemically unrelated to lamotrigine. This evidence suggests, although it certainly does not prove, that the high SUDEP rates reflect population rates, not drug effect.. 5.13 Addition of Lamotrigine Tablets to Multidrug Regimen that Includes Valproate Because valproate reduces the clearance of lamotrigine, the dosage of lamotrigine in the presence of valproate is less than half of that required in its absence see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4), Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.14 Binding in the Eye and Other Melanin-Containing Tissues. Because lamotrigine binds to melanin, it could accumulate in melanin-rich tissues over time. This raises the possibility that lamotrigine may cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. Although ophthalmological testing was performed in controlled clinical trial, the testing was inadequate to exclude subtle effects or injury occurring after long-term exposure. Moreover, the capacity of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences, if any, of lamotrigines binding to melanin is unknown see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Accordingly, although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmological monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects.. 5.15 Laboratory Tests. False-Positive Drug Test ResultsLamotrigine has been reported to interfere with the assay used in some rapid urine drug screens, which can result in false-positive readings, particularly for phencyclidine (PCP). more specific analytical method should be used to confirm positive result.Plasma Concentrations of LamotrigineThe value of monitoring plasma concentrations of lamotrigine in patients treated with lamotrigine tablets has not been established. Because of the possible pharmacokinetic interactions between lamotrigine and other drugs, including AEDs (see Table 13), monitoring of the plasma levels of lamotrigine and concomitant drugs may be indicated, particularly during dosage adjustments. In general, clinical judgment should be exercised regarding monitoring of plasma levels of lamotrigine and other drugs and whether or not dosage adjustments are necessary.",ca0c88a7-3b5f-4b5d-92ae-ebddc86ac257,43685-7,WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION

There are no adequate and well controlled studies of fenofibrate in pregnant women. Fenofibrate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In female rats given oral dietary doses of 15 mg/kg/day, 75 mg/kg/day, and 300 mg/kg/day of fenofibrate from 15 days prior to mating through weaning, maternal toxicity was observed at 0.3 times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m2 In pregnant rats given oral dietary doses of 14 mg/kg/day, 127 mg/kg/day, and 361 mg/kg/day from gestation day to 15 during the period of organogenesis, adverse developmental findings were not observed at 14 mg/kg/day (less than times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m2). At higher multiples of human doses evidence of maternal toxicity was observed. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 15 mg/kg/day, 150 mg/kg/day, and 300 mg/kg/day from gestation day to 18 during the period of organogenesis and allowed to deliver, aborted litters were observed at 150 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons: mg/m2). No developmental findings were observed at 15 mg/kg/day (at less than times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m2). In pregnant rats given oral dietary doses of 15 mg/kg/day, 75 mg/kg/day, and 300 mg/kg/day from gestation day 15 through lactation day 21 (weaning), maternal toxicity was observed at less than times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m2. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Fenofibrate should not be used in nursing mothers. decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Fenofibric acid is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Fenofibric acid exposure is not influenced by age. Since elderly patients have higher incidence of renal impairment, dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Elderly patients with normal renal function should require no dose modifications. Consider monitoring renal function in elderly patients taking fenofibrate tablets. 8.6Renal Impairment The use of fenofibrate tablets should be avoided in patients who have severe renal impairment [see Contraindications (4)]. Dose reduction is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitoring renal function in patients with renal impairment is recommended. 8.7Hepatic Impairment The use of fenofibrate tablets has not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",2e6e800b-23a6-4032-88c3-d29beb2d35fc,43684-0,USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS SECTION

27888921,"WARNINGS Hyperkalemia (see OVERDOSAGE): In patients with impaired mechanisms for excreting potassium, the administration of potassium salts can produce hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest. This occurs most commonly in patients given potassium by the intravenous route but may also occur in patients given potassium orally. Potentially fatal hyperkalemia can develop rapidly and be asymptomatic. The use of potassium salts in patients with chronic renal disease, or any other condition which impairs potassium excretion, requires particularly careful monitoring of the serum potassium concentration and appropriate dosage adjustment. Interaction with Potassium-sparing Diuretics: Hypokalemia should not be treated by the concomitant administration of potassium salts and potassium-sparing diuretic (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene or amiloride), since the simultaneous administration of these agents can produce severe hyperkalemia. Interaction with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g., captopril, enalapril) will produce some potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Potassium supplements should be given to patients receiving ACE inhibitors only with close monitoring. Gastrointestinal Lesions: Solid oral dosage forms of potassium chloride can produce ulcerative and/or stenotic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. Based on spontaneous adverse reaction reports, enteric-coated preparations of potassium chloride are associated with an increased frequency of small bowel lesions (40-50 per 100,000 patient years) compared to extended-release wax matrix formulations (less than one per 100,000 patient years). Because of the lack of extensive marketing experience with microencapsulated products, comparison between such products and wax matrix or enteric-coated products is not available. Klor-Con(R) Extended-release Tablets are wax matrix tablets formulated to provide an extended rate of release of potassium chloride and thus to minimize the possibility of high local concentration of potassium near the gastrointestinal wall. Prospective trials have been conducted in normal human volunteers in which the upper gastrointestinal tract was evaluated by endoscopic inspection before and after one week of solid oral potassium chloride therapy. The ability of this model to predict events occurring in usual clinical practice is unknown. Trials which approximated usual clinical practice did not reveal any clear differences between the wax matrix and microencapsulated dosage forms. In contrast, there was higher incidence of gastric and duodenal lesions in subjects receiving high dose of wax matrix extended-release formulation under conditions which did not resemble usual or recommended clinical practice (i.e., 96 mEq per day in divided doses of potassium chloride administered to fasted patients, in the presence of an anticholinergic drug to delay gastric emptying). The upper gastrointestinal lesions observed by endoscopy were asymptomatic and were not accompanied by evidence of bleeding (hemoccult testing). The relevance of these findings to the usual conditions (i.e., non-fasting, no anticholinergic agent, smaller doses) under which extended-release potassium chloride products are used is uncertain; epidemiologic studies have not identified an elevated risk, compared to microencapsulated products, for upper gastrointestinal lesions in patients receiving wax matrix formulations. Klor-Con(R) Extended-release Tablets should be discontinued immediately and the possibility of ulceration, obstruction or perforation considered if severe vomiting, abdominal pain, distention or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs. Metabolic Acidosis: Hypokalemia in patients with metabolic acidosis should be treated with an alkalinizing potassium salt such as potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, potassium acetate or potassium gluconate.",cd9e04d1-4a0a-4885-9ccb-8a51ff112465,34071-1,WARNINGS SECTION

27915715,"12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. 12.1 Mechanism of Action. Amlodipine is dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in gradual onset of effect.Amlodipine is peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include the following:. Exertional Angina: In patients with exertional angina, amlodipine reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise.. Vasospastic Angina: Amlodipine has been demonstrated to block constriction and restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels in vitro. This inhibition of coronary spasm is responsible for the effectiveness of amlodipine in vasospastic (Prinzmetals or variant) angina.. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics. Hemodynamics: Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine besylate tablets produce vasodilation resulting in reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina.With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine besylate tablets is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105-114 mmHg) had about 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90-104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/-2 mmHg).In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine besylate tablets resulted in decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine besylate tablets have generally demonstrated small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine besylate tablets have not been associated with negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when co-administered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normal or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects.. Electrophysiologic Effects: Amlodipine besylate tablets do not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine besylate tablets and concomitant beta-blockers. In clinical studies in which amlodipine besylate tablets were administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, amlodipine besylate tablet therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV blocks.. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics. After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine besylate tablets, absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between and 12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 90%. The bioavailability of amlodipine besylate tablets is not altered by the presence of food.Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. Ex vivo studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with terminal elimination half-life of about 30-50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after to days of consecutive daily dosing.The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. Patients with renal failure may therefore receive the usual initial dose.Elderly patients and patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40-60%, and lower initial dose may be required. similar increase in AUC was observed in patients with moderate to severe heart failure.. 12.4 Pediatric Patients. Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged to 17 years received doses of amlodipine besylate tablets between 1.25 mg and 20 mg. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values in adults.",767c1e67-4cfb-4358-a963-3d58122c8e83,34090-1,CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION

The dose should be increased daily in increments of 25 mg/day to 50 mg/day to an effective dose, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the patient.. 2.5 Dose Modifications when used with CYP3A4 Inhibitors. Quetiapine tablets dose should be reduced to one sixth of original dose when co-medicated with potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.). When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, the dose of quetiapine tablets should be increased by fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 2.6 Dose Modifications when used with CYP3A4 Inducers. Quetiapine tablets dose should be increased up to 5-fold of the original dose when used in combination with chronic treatment (e.g., greater than to 14 days) of potent CYP3A4 inducer (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, avasimibe, St. Johns wort etc.). The dose should be titrated based on the clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient. When the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the dose of quetiapine tablets should be reduced to the original level within to 14 days [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 2.7 Re-initiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued. Although there are no data to specifically address re-initiation of treatment, it is recommended that when restarting therapy of patients who have been off quetiapine tablets for more than one week, the initial dosing schedule should be followed. When restarting patients who have been off quetiapine tablets for less than one week, gradual dose escalation may not be required and the maintenance dose may be re-initiated.. 2.8 Switching from Antipsychotics. There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients with schizophrenia from antipsychotics to quetiapine tablets, or concerning concomitant administration with antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients with schizophrenia, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized. When switching patients with schizophrenia from depot antipsychotics, if medically appropriate, initiate quetiapine tablets therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. The need for continuing existing EPS medication should be re-evaluated periodically.",87222d90-dfd4-4a57-e053-2991aa0aed86,34068-7,DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION SECTION

28539322,"Fluconazole is generally well tolerated.In some patients, particularly those with serious underlying diseases such as AIDS and cancer, changes in renal and hematological function test results and hepatic abnormalities have been observed during treatment with fluconazole and comparative agents, but the clinical significance and relationship to treatment is uncertain.In Patients Receiving Single Dose for Vaginal Candidiasis: During comparative clinical studies conducted in the United States, 448 patients with vaginal candidiasis were treated with fluconazole, 150 mg single dose. The overall incidence of side effects possibly related to fluconazole was 26%. In 422 patients receiving active comparative agents, the incidence was 16%. The most common treatment-related adverse events reported in the patients who received 150 mg single dose fluconazole for vaginitis were headache (13%), nausea (7%), and abdominal pain (6%). Other side effects reported with an incidence equal to or greater than 1% included diarrhea (3%), dyspepsia (1%), dizziness (1%), and taste perversion (1%). Most of the reported side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Rarely, angioedema and anaphylactic reaction have been reported in marketing experience.In Patients Receiving Multiple Doses for Other Infections: Sixteen percent of over 4000 patients treated with fluconazole in clinical trials of days or more experienced adverse events. Treatment was discontinued in 1.5% of patients due to adverse clinical events and in 1.3% of patients due to laboratory test abnormalities.Clinical adverse events were reported more frequently in HIV infected patients (21%) than in non-HIV infected patients (13%); however, the patterns in HIV infected and non-HIV infected patients were similar. The proportions of patients discontinuing therapy due to clinical adverse events were similar in the two groups (1.5%).The following treatment-related clinical adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in 4048 patients receiving fluconazole for or more days in clinical trials: nausea 3.7%, headache 1.9%, skin rash 1.8%, vomiting 1.7%, abdominal pain 1.7%, and diarrhea 1.5%.Hepato-biliary: In combined clinical trials and marketing experience, there have been rare cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with fluconazole. (SEE WARNINGS.) The spectrum of these hepatic reactions has ranged from mild transient elevations in transaminases to clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities. Instances of fatal hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly AIDS or malignancy) and often while taking multiple concomitant medications. Transient hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. In each of these cases, liver function returned to baseline on discontinuation of fluconazole.In two comparative trials evaluating the efficacy of fluconazole for the suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis, statistically significant increase was observed in median AST (SGOT) levels from baseline value of 30 IU/L to 41 IU/L in one trial and 34 IU/L to 66 IU/L in the other. The overall rate of serum transaminase elevations of more than times the upper limit of normal was approximately 1% in fluconazole-treated patients in clinical trials. These elevations occurred in patients with severe underlying disease, predominantly AIDS or malignancies, most of whom were receiving multiple concomitant medications, including many known to be hepatotoxic. The incidence of abnormally elevated serum transaminases was greater in patients taking fluconazole concomitantly with one or more of the following medications: rifampin, phenytoin, isoniazid, valproic acid, or oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents.Post-Marketing Experience In addition, the following adverse events have occurred during post-marketing experience.Immunologic: In rare cases, anaphylaxis (including angioedema, face edema and pruritus) has been reported.Body as Whole: Asthenia, fatigue, fever, malaise.Cardiovascular: QT prolongation, torsade de pointes. (SEE PRECAUTIONS.)Central Nervous System: Seizures, dizziness.Hematopoietic and Lymphatic: Leukopenia, including neutropenia and agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia.Metabolic: Hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypokalemia.Gastrointestinal: Cholestasis, dry mouth, hepatocellular damage, dyspepsia, vomiting.Other Senses: Taste perversion.Musculoskeletal System: myalgia.Nervous System: Insomnia, paresthesia, somnolence, tremor, vertigo.Skin and Appendages: Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, drug eruption including fixed drug eruption, increased sweating, exfoliative skin disorders including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) (SEE WARNINGS), alopecia.Adverse Reactions in Children: The pattern and incidence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities recorded during pediatric clinical trials are comparable to those seen in adults.In Phase II/III clinical trials conducted in the United States and in Europe, 577 pediatric patients, ages day to 17 years were treated with fluconazole at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day for up to 1,616 days. Thirteen percent of children experienced treatment-related adverse events. The most commonly reported events were vomiting (5%), abdominal pain (3%), nausea (2%), and diarrhea (2%). Treatment was discontinued in 2.3% of patients due to adverse clinical events and in 1.4% of patients due to laboratory test abnormalities.

28813460,"Geriatric Use:. In elderly and debilitated patients it is recommended that dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia, oversedation, confusion or anticholinergic effects.Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets, 74 individuals were 65 years and older. An additional 34 subjects were between 60 and 69 years of age. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.The active ingredients in chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function.Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets and observed closely.Clinical studies of chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",b20dcdb1-50f4-4d49-a50e-be0308962f5b,34082-8,GERIATRIC USE SECTION

To achieve an optimal therapeutic response, at intervals of to days the dosage may be increased mg per day, as needed. The maximum daily dosage should not exceed 60 mg per day. In clinical trials allowing dose titration, divided doses of 20 to 30 mg per day were commonly employed.The bioavailability of buspirone is increased when given with food as compared to the fasted state (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Consequently, patients should take buspirone in consistent manner with regard to the timing of dosing; either always with or always without food.When buspirone is to be given with potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 the dosage recommendations described in the PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions section should be followed.Switching Patient To or From Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) AntidepressantAt least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat depression and initiation of therapy with buspirone hydrochloride tablets. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping buspirone hydrochloride tablets before starting an MAOI antidepressant CONTRAINDICATIONS and DRUG INTERACTIONS).Use of buspirone hydrochloride tablets with (Reversible) MAOIs, Such as Linezolid or Methylene BlueDo not start buspirone hydrochloride tablets in patient who is being treated with reversible MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In patient who requires more urgent treatment of psychiatric condition, non-pharmacological interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and DRUG INTERACTIONS).In some cases, patient already receiving therapy with buspirone hydrochloride tablets may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in particular patient, buspirone hydrochloride tablets should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with buspirone hydrochloride tablets may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (see WARNINGS).The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than mg per kg with buspirone hydrochloride tablets is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and DRUG INTERACTIONS).",63e2d4e2-f1ab-480d-b0bb-79b6cdb57a5d,34068-7,DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION SECTION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).Risks from Concomitant Use with OpioidsAdvise both patients and caregivers about the risks of potentially fatal respiratory depression and sedation when alprazolam is used with opioids and not to use such drugs concomitantly unless supervised by healthcare provider. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Abuse, Misuse, and AddictionInform patients that the use of alprazolam, even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)].Withdrawal ReactionsInform patients that the continued use of alprazolam may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of alprazolam may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. Inform patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients that discontinuation or dosage reduction of alprazolam may require slow taper [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].Effects on Driving and Operating MachineryAdvise patients not to drive motor vehicle or operate heavy machinery while taking alprazolam due to its CNS depressant effects. Also advise patients to avoid use of alcohol or other CNS depressants while taking alprazolam [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].Patients with DepressionAdvise patients, their families, and caregivers to look for signs of suicidality or worsening depression, and to inform the patients healthcare provider immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].Concomitant MedicationsAdvise patients to inform their healthcare provider of all medicines they take, including prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins and herbal supplements [see Drug Interactions (7)].PregnancyBenzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and sedation in neonates. Advise mothers using alprazolam to monitor neonates for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, withdrawal symptoms, and feeding problems. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with alprazolam [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4). Advise patients that there is pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

28342850,"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. Lisinopril-HydrochlorothiazideAs result of its diuretic effects, hydrochlorothiazide increases plasma renin activity, increases aldosterone secretion, and decreases serum potassium. Administration of lisinopril blocks the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone axis and tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with the diuretic.In clinical studies, the extent of blood pressure reduction seen with the combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was approximately additive. The Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets 10/12.5 combination worked equally well in Black and Caucasian patients. The Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets 20/12.5 and Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets 20/25 (a previously marketed strength) combinations appeared somewhat less effective in Black patients, but relatively few Black patients were studied. In most patients, the antihypertensive effect of Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets was sustained for at least 24 hours.In randomized, controlled comparison, the mean antihypertensive effects of Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets 20/12.5 and Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets 20/25 were similar, suggesting that many patients who respond adequately to the latter combination may be controlled with Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets 20/12.5 (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide has little or no effect on the bioavailability of either drug. The combination tablet is bioequivalent to concomitant administration of the separate entities.LisinoprilMechanism of ActionLisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in small increase of serum potassium. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was less than 0.1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15 percent of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately six percent had decrease greater than0.5 mEq/L. In the same study, patients treated with lisinopril plus thiazide diuretic showed essentially no change in serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS). ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, potent vasodepressor peptide, play role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated.While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually low-renin hypertensive population) had smaller average response to lisinopril monotherapy than non-Black patients.Pharmacokinetics and MetabolismFollowing oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations occur within about hours. Declining serum concentrations exhibit prolonged terminal phase which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins.Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25 percent, with large intersubject variability (6 to 60 percent) at all doses tested (5 to 80 mg). Lisinopril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract.Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of accumulation of 12 hours.Impaired renal function decreases elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below30 mL/min. Above this glomerular filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to attain steady state is prolonged. Older patients, on average, have (approximately doubled) higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis. Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly. Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues. However, milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14C lisinopril. By whole body autoradiography, radioactivity was found in the placenta following administration of labeled drug to pregnant rats, but none was found in the fetuses.PharmacodynamicsAdministration of lisinopril to patients with hypertension results in reduction of supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt-depleted patients (see WARNINGS). In most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by six hours.In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require two to four weeks of therapy.At recommended single daily doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for at least 24 hours after dosing, although the effect at 24 hours was substantially smaller than the effect six hours after dosing.The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril have continued during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with rapid increase in blood pressure; nor with significant overshoot of pretreatment blood pressure.In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac output and in heart rate. In study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant. Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not large.In patients with renovascular hypertension lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in controlling blood pressure (see PRECAUTIONS). HydrochlorothiazideThe mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Thiazides do not usually affect normal blood pressure.Hydrochlorothiazide is diuretic and antihypertensive. It affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. Hydrochlorothiazide increases excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate.After oral use diuresis begins within two hours, peaks in about four hours and lasts about to 12 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. When plasma levels havebeen followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. At least 61 percent of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier.",caefc29d-1d6b-4b65-983d-5e89d4b77fd5,34090-1,CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION

Inform patients of the following: Advise patients to change to non-hormonal forms of birth control, if hormonal methods are used. Use BLEMISH ERASER as directed by the health care provider and do not use BLEMISH ERASER for any disorder other than that for which it is prescribed. Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamp, or ultraviolet light. Patients who are consistently exposed to sunlight or skin irritants either through their work environment or habits should exercise particular caution. Use sunscreen and protective covering (such as the use of hat) over the treated areas. Sunscreen use is an essential aspect of melasma therapy, as even minimal sunlight sustains melanocytic activity. Weather extremes, such as heat or cold, may be irritating to patients treated with BLEMISH ERASER. Because of the drying effect of this medication, moisturizer may be applied to the face in the morning after washing. Keep BLEMISH ERASER away from the eyes, nose, angles of the mouth, or open wounds because these areas are more sensitive to the irritant effect. If local irritation persists or becomes severe, discontinue application of the medication and consult your health care provider. Seek medical attention if you experience allergic contact dermatitis, blistering, crusting, and severe burning or swelling of the skin and irritation of the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth. If the medication is applied excessively, marked redness, peeling, or discomfort may occur.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Over 8500 patients with type diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2605 patients with type diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride in the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride for six months or longer, over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride for one year or longer, and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride for at least two years. In six pooled 16 to 26 week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16 to 24 week add-on combination therapy trials, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control, although the incidence of these events was lower (1.5%) with pioglitazone hydrochloride than with placebo (3.0%). In the PROactive trial, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9.0% for patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients. Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo.

Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins and fibrates). At baseline, patients had mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone hydrochloride on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio 0.90; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.80, 1.02; = 0.10). Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone hydrochloride and placebo for the three- year incidence of first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone hydrochloride. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 9.

One randomized, double-blind year trial comparing pioglitazone hydrochloride to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride in the pioglitazone hydrochloride controlled clinical trial database to date have had serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. HypoglycemiaIn the pioglitazone hydrochloride clinical trials, adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing. In the 16 week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16 week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg, and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone 45 mg compared to pioglitazone 30 mg in both the 24 week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% vs. 13.4%) and in the 24 week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% vs. 43.5%). Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24 week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patients usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (n 2) or pioglitazone 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (n 12). Urinary Bladder TumorsTumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study see Nonclinical Toxicology 13.1) ]. During the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone hydrochloride and out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone hydrochloride and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone hydrochloride. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone hydrochloride or placebo (HR 1.00; 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.72) see Warnings and Precautions 5.4) ]. Laboratory Abnormalities Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone hydrochloride may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride compared with mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone hydrochloride therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Creatine PhosphokinaseDuring protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone hydrochloride clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone hydrochloride, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing and one patient discontinued pioglitazone hydrochloride due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone hydrochloride therapy is unknown.. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pioglitazone hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish causal relationship to drug exposure. New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity see Warnings and Precautions 5.7) ]. Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure see Warnings and Precautions 5.3) ]. Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone hydrochloride, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions 5.1) ].

27982617,"Mechanism of Action:. Metoprolol Tartrate is beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocker. This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher plasma concentrations, Metoprolol Tartrate also inhibits beta2-adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature.Clinical pharmacology studies have demonstrated the beta-blocking activity of metoprolol, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood pressure upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.HypertensionThe mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents has not been fully elucidated. However, several possible mechanisms have been proposed: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output; (2) central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery; and (3) suppression of renin activity.Angina PectorisBy blocking catecholamine-induced increases in heart rate, in velocity and extent of myocardial contraction, and in blood pressure, Metoprolol Tartrate reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort, thus making it useful in the long-term management of angina pectoris.Myocardial Infarction The precise mechanism of action of Metoprolol Tartrate in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction is not known.",52f26657-9fa7-4cee-bfa0-a07987b2f706,43679-0,MECHANISM OF ACTION SECTION

(5.8, 16, 17). 5.1 Serious Skin Rashes [see Boxed Warning]. Pediatric Population The incidence of serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of lamotrigine in prospectively followed cohort of pediatric patients (aged to 17 years) is approximately 0.3% to 0.8%. One rash-related death was reported in prospectively followed cohort of 1,983 pediatric patients (aged to 16 years) with epilepsy taking lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy. Additionally, there have been rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis with and without permanent sequelae and/or death in U.S. and foreign postmarketing experience.There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in pediatric patients. In pediatric patients who used valproate concomitantly for epilepsy, 1.2% (6 of 482) experienced serious rash compared with 0.6% (6 of 952) patients not taking valproate. Adult Population Serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of lamotrigine occurred in 0.3% (11 of 3,348) of adult patients who received lamotrigine in premarketing clinical trials of epilepsy. In the bipolar and other mood disorders clinical trials, the rate of serious rash was 0.08% (1 of 1,233) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as initial monotherapy and 0.13% (2 of 1,538) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy. No fatalities occurred among these individuals. However, in worldwide postmarketing experience, rare cases of rash-related death have been reported, but their numbers are too few to permit precise estimate of the rate. Among the rashes leading to hospitalization were Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, and those associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in adults. Specifically, of 584 patients administered lamotrigine with valproate in epilepsy clinical trials, (1%) were hospitalized in association with rash; in contrast, (0.16%) of 2,398 clinical trial patients and volunteers administered lamotrigine in the absence of valproate were hospitalized. Patients with History of Allergy or Rash to Other Antiepileptic Drugs The risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation for lamotrigine is exceeded and in patients with history of allergy or rash to other AEDs. 5.2 Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has occurred in pediatric and adult patients taking lamotrigine for various indications. HLH is life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. It is associated with high mortality rates if not recognized early and treated. Common findings include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, neurologic symptoms, cytopenias, high serum ferritin, hypertriglyceridemia, and liver function and coagulation abnormalities. In cases of HLH reported with lamotrigine, patients have presented with signs of systemic inflammation (fever, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and organ system dysfunction) and blood dyscrasias. Symptoms have been reported to occur within to 24 days following the initiation of treatment. Patients who develop early manifestations of pathologic immune activation should be evaluated immediately, and diagnosis of HLH should be considered. Lamotrigine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.. 5.3 Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions and Organ Failure. Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have occurred with lamotrigine. Some have been fatal or life threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. Fatalities associated with acute multiorgan failure and various degrees of hepatic failure have been reported in of 3,796 adult patients and of 2,435 pediatric patients who received lamotrigine in epilepsy clinical trials. Rare fatalities from multiorgan failure have also been reported in postmarketing use.Isolated liver failure without rash or involvement of other organs has also been reported with lamotrigine. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Lamotrigine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. Prior to initiation of treatment with lamotrigine, the patient should be instructed that rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may herald serious medical event and that the patient should report any such occurrence to healthcare provider immediately. 5.4 Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities. In vitro testing showed that lamotrigine exhibits Class IB antiarrhythmic activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.2)]. Based on these in vitro findings, Lamotrigine could slow ventricular conduction (widen QRS) and induce proarrhythmia, which can lead to sudden death, in patients with clinically important structural or functional heart disease (i.e., patients with heart failure, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, conduction system disease, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac channelopathies [e.g., Brugada syndrome], clinically important ischemic heart disease, or multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease). Any expected or observed benefit of lamotrigine in an individual patient with clinically important structural or functional heart disease must be carefully weighed against the risks for serious arrythmias and/or death for that patient. Concomitant use of other sodium channel blockers may further increase the risk of proarrhythmia.. 5.5 Blood Dyscrasias. There have been reports of blood dyscrasias that may or may not be associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity (also known as DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. These have included neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and, rarely, aplastic anemia and pure red cell aplasia. 5.6 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation. AEDs, including lamotrigine, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared with 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanism of action and across range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 7. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients Drug Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing lamotrigine or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, the emergence of suicidal thoughts or suicidal behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.7 Aseptic Meningitis. Therapy with lamotrigine increases the risk of developing aseptic meningitis. Because of the potential for serious outcomes of untreated meningitis due to other causes, patients should also be evaluated for other causes of meningitis and treated as appropriate. Postmarketing cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported in pediatric and adult patients taking lamotrigine for various indications. Symptoms upon presentation have included headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and nuchal rigidity. Rash, photophobia, myalgia, chills, altered consciousness, and somnolence were also noted in some cases. Symptoms have been reported to occur within day to one and half months following the initiation of treatment. In most cases, symptoms were reported to resolve after discontinuation of lamotrigine. Re-exposure resulted in rapid return of symptoms (from within 30 minutes to day following re-initiation of treatment) that were frequently more severe. Some of the patients treated with lamotrigine who developed aseptic meningitis had underlying diagnoses of systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyzed at the time of clinical presentation in reported cases was characterized by mild to moderate pleocytosis, normal glucose levels, and mild to moderate increase in protein. CSF white blood cell count differentials showed predominance of neutrophils in majority of the cases, although predominance of lymphocytes was reported in approximately one third of the cases. Some patients also had new onset of signs and symptoms of involvement of other organs (predominantly hepatic and renal involvement), which may suggest that in these cases the aseptic meningitis observed was part of hypersensitivity reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.8 Potential Medication Errors. Medication errors involving lamotrigine have occurred. In particular, the names lamotrigine or lamotrigine can be confused with the names of other commonly used medications. Medication errors may also occur between the different formulations of lamotrigine. To reduce the potential of medication errors, write and say lamotrigine clearly. Depictions of the lamotrigine tablets can be found in the Medication Guide that accompanies the product to highlight the distinctive markings, colors, and shapes that serve to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help reduce the risk of medication errors. To avoid the medication error of using the wrong drug or formulation, patients should be strongly advised to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are lamotrigine, as well as the correct formulation of lamotrigine, each time they fill their prescription.. 5.9 Concomitant Use with Oral Contraceptives. Some estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to decrease serum concentrations of lamotrigine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage adjustments will be necessary in most patients who start or stop estrogen-containing oral contraceptives while taking lamotrigine [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. During the week of inactive hormone preparation (pill-free week) of oral contraceptive therapy, plasma lamotrigine levels are expected to rise, as much as doubling at the end of the week. Adverse reactions consistent with elevated levels of lamotrigine, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia, could occur. 5.10 Withdrawal Seizures. As with other AEDs, lamotrigine should not be abruptly discontinued. In patients with epilepsy there is possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In clinical trials in adults with bipolar disorder, patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine. Unless safety concerns require more rapid withdrawal, the dose of lamotrigine should be tapered over period of at least weeks (approximately 50% reduction per week) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.11 Status Epilepticus. Valid estimates of the incidence of treatment-emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with lamotrigine are difficult to obtain because reporters participating in clinical trials did not all employ identical rules for identifying cases. At minimum, of 2,343 adult patients had episodes that could unequivocally be described as status epilepticus. In addition, number of reports of variably defined episodes of seizure exacerbation (e.g., seizure clusters, seizure flurries) were made. 5.12 Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). During the premarketing development of lamotrigine, 20 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among cohort of 4,700 patients with epilepsy (5,747 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0035 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients not receiving lamotrigine (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of patients with epilepsy, to 0.004 for recently studied clinical trial population similar to that in the clinical development program for lamotrigine, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or suggest concern depends on the comparability of the populations reported upon with the cohort receiving lamotrigine and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Probably most reassuring is the similarity of estimated SUDEP rates in patients receiving lamotrigine and those receiving other AEDs, chemically unrelated to each other, that underwent clinical testing in similar populations. Importantly, that drug is chemically unrelated to lamotrigine. This evidence suggests, although it certainly does not prove, that the high SUDEP rates reflect population rates, not drug effect. 5.13 Addition of Lamotrigine to Multidrug Regimen that Includes Valproate. Because valproate reduces the clearance of lamotrigine, the dosage of lamotrigine in the presence of valproate is less than half of that required in its absence [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4), Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.14 Binding in the Eye and Other Melanin-Containing Tissues. Because lamotrigine binds to melanin, it could accumulate in melanin-rich tissues over time. This raises the possibility that lamotrigine may cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. Although ophthalmological testing was performed in controlled clinical trial, the testing was inadequate to exclude subtle effects or injury occurring after long-term exposure. Moreover, the capacity of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences, if any, of lamotrigines binding to melanin is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Accordingly, although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmological monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects. 5.15 Laboratory Tests. False-Positive Drug Test Results Lamotrigine has been reported to interfere with the assay used in some rapid urine drug screens, which can result in false-positive readings, particularly for phencyclidine (PCP). more specific analytical method should be used to confirm positive result. Plasma Concentrations of Lamotrigine The value of monitoring plasma concentrations of lamotrigine in patients treated with lamotrigine has not been established. Because of the possible pharmacokinetic interactions between lamotrigine and other drugs, including AEDs (see Table 13), monitoring of the plasma levels of lamotrigine and concomitant drugs may be indicated, particularly during dosage adjustments. In general, clinical judgment should be exercised regarding monitoring of plasma levels of lamotrigine and other drugs and whether or not dosage adjustments are necessary.",5385bad8-09f2-41ba-9858-19de9c989647,43685-7,WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION

Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to accurate calculation of the dose of zidovudine tablets, transcription of the medication order, dispensing information and dosing instructions to minimize risk for medication dosing errors. Prescribers should calculate the appropriate dose of zidovudine tablets for each child based on body weight (kg) and should not exceed the recommended adult dose. Before prescribing zidovudine tablets, children should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets. If child is unable to reliably swallow zidovudine tablet, the zidovudine syrup formulation should be prescribed.

Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with hydrOXYzine their dosage should be reduced.Since drowsiness may occur with use of this drug, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving car or operating dangerous machinery while taking hydrOXYzine. Patients should also be advised against the simultaneous use of other CNS depressant drugs, and cautioned that the effects of alcohol may be increased.Geriatric Use: determination has not been made whether controlled clinical studies of hydrOXYzine included sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to define difference in response from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.The extent of renal excretion of hydrOXYzine has not been determined. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selections.Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of hydrOXYzine and observed closely.",61283c3b-9773-4cf8-bedf-ac3109684f55,42232-9,PRECAUTIONS SECTION

27952231,"PRECAUTIONS. General Precautions:. Barbiturates induce liver microsomal enzyme activity. This accelerates the biotransformation of various drugs and is probably part of the mechanism of the tolerance encountered with barbiturates. Phenobarbital, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with decreased liver function. This drug should also be administered cautiously to patients with history of drug dependence or abuse(see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ).Phenobarbital may decrease the potency of coumarin anticoagulants; therefore, patients receiving such concomitant therapy should have more frequent prothrombin determinations. As with other sedatives and hypnotics, elderly or debilitated patients may react to barbiturates with marked exctextent, depression, or confusion.The systemic effects of exogenous hydrocortisone and endogenous hydrocortisone (cortisol) may be diminished by phenobarbital. Thus, this product should be administered with caution to patients with borderline hypoadrenal function, regardless of whether it is of pituitary or of primary adrenal origin.. Information for Patients:. Phenobarbital may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving car or operating machinery. The patient should be cautioned accordingly.. Drug Interactions: Phenobarbital in combination with alcohol, tranquilizers, and other central nervous system depressants has additive depressant effects, and the patients should be so advised. Patients taking this drug should be warned not to exceed the dosage recommended by their physician. Toxic effects and fatalities have occurred following overdoses of phenobarbital alone and in combination with other central nervous system depressants. Caution should be exercised in prescribing unnecessarily large amounts of phenobarbital for patients who have history of emotional disturbances or suicidal ideation or who have misused alcohol and other CNS drugs (see OVERDOSAGE).. Usage in Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category - Reproduction studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to phenobarbital. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed..

28597698,"WARNINGS. The use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risks of several serious conditions including myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, stroke, hepatic neoplasia, and gallbladder disease, although the risk of serious morbidity or mortality is very small in healthy women without underlying risk factors. The risk of morbidity and mortality increases significantly in the presence of other underlying risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemias, obesity, and diabetes.Practitioners prescribing oral contraceptives should be familiar with the following information relating to these risks.The information contained in this package insert is principally based on studies carried out in patients who used oral contraceptives with higher formulations of estrogens and progestogens than those in common use today. The effect of long-term use of the oral contraceptives with lower formulations of both estrogens and progestogens remains to be determined.Throughout this labeling, epidemiological studies reported are of two types: retrospective or case control studies and prospective or cohort studies. Case control studies provide measure of the relative risk of disease, namely, ratio of the incidence of disease among oral contraceptive users to that among nonusers. The relative risk does not provide information on the actual clinical occurrence of disease. Cohort studies provide measure of attributable risk, which is the difference in the incidence of disease between oral contraceptive users and nonusers. The attributable risk does provide information about the actual occurrence of disease in the population (adapted from References and with the authors permission). For further information, the reader is referred to text on epidemiological methods.1. Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problemsa. Myocardial infarctionAn increased risk of myocardial infarction has been attributed to oral contraceptive use. This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other underlying risk factors for coronary artery disease such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes. The relative risk of heart attack for current oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be two to six (10 to 16). The risk is very low under the age of 30.Smoking in combination with oral contraceptive use has been shown to contribute substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarctions in women in their mid-thirties or older with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases (17). Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown to increase substantially in smokers over the age of 35 and non-smokers over the age of 40 (Table II) among women who use oral contraceptives.Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, age and obesity (19). In particular, some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create state of hyperinsulinism (20 to 24).Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure among users (see section in WARNINGS). Similar effects on risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease.Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.b. ThromboembolismAn increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of oral contraceptives is well established. Case control studies have found the relative risk of users compared to non-users to be for the first episode of superficial venous thrombosis, to 11 for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and 1.5 to for women with predisposing conditions for venous thromboembolic disease (9, 10, 25 to 30). Cohort studies have shown the relative risk to be somewhat lower, about for new cases and about 4.5 for new cases requiring hospitalization (31). The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives is not related to length of use and disappears after pill use is stopped (8).A two- to four-fold increase in relative risk of postoperative thromboembolic complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives (15, 32). The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is twice that of women without such medical conditions (15, 32). If feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least four weeks prior to and for two weeks after elective surgery of type associated with an increase in risk of thromboembolism and during and following prolonged immobilization. Since the immediate postpartum period is also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than four to six weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breastfeed.c. Cerebrovascular diseaseOral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (greater than 35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke. Hypertension was found to be risk factor for both users and nonusers, for both types of strokes, while smoking interacted to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes (33 to 35).In large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension (36). The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for non-smokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users, and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension (36). The attributable risk is also greater in older women (9).d. Dose-related risk of vascular disease from oral contraceptivesA positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease (37 to 39). decline in serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents (20 to 22). decline in serum high-density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease. Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestin and the nature of the progestin used in the contraceptives. The amount and activity of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular oral contraceptive, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest dose of estrogen which produces satisfactory results for the patient.e. Persistence of risk of vascular diseaseThere are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives. In study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least years for women 40 to 49 years who had used oral contraceptives for or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups (14). In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small (40). However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 mcg or higher of estrogens.2. Estimates of Mortality from Contraceptive UseOne study gathered data from variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table III). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with childbirth. The observation of possible increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970s but not reported until 1983 (41). However, current clinical practice involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations combined with careful restriction of oral contraceptive use to women who do not have the various risk factors listed in this labeling.Because of these changes in practice and, also, because of some limited new data which suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the use of oral contraceptives may now be less than previously observed (Porter JB, Hunter J, Jick H, et al. Oral contraceptives and nonfatal vascular disease. Obstet Gynecol 1985;66:1-4; and Porter JB, Hershel J, Walker AM. Mortality among oral contraceptive users. Obstet Gynecol 1987;70:29-32), the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the topic in 1989. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception.Therefore, the Committee recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks. Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take the lowest possible dose formulation that is effective.TABLE III RELATED DEATHS ASSOCIATED WITH CONTROL OF FERTILITY PER 100,000 NONSTERILE WOMEN, BY FERTILITY CONTROL METHOD ACCORDING TO AGEMethod of control and outcome15 to 1920 to 2425 to 2930 to 3435 to 3940 to 44No fertility control methods77.49.114.825.728.2Oral contraceptives non-smoker0.30.50.91.913.831.6Oral contraceptives smoker2.23.46.613.551.1117.2IUD0.80.8111.41.4Condom1.11.60.70.20.30.4Diaphragm/spermicide1.91.21.21.32.22.8Periodic abstinence2.51.61.61.72.93.6Deaths are birth related.Deaths are method related.Adapted from H.W. Ory, Reference 41.3. Carcinoma of the Reproductive OrgansNumerous epidemiological studies have been performed on the incidence of breast, endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancer in women using oral contraceptives. Most of the studies on breast cancer and oral contraceptive use report that the use of oral contraceptives is not associated with an increase in the risk of developing breast cancer (42, 44, 89). Some studies have reported an increased risk of developing breast cancer in certain subgroups of oral contraceptive users, but the findings reported in these studies are not consistent (43, 45 to 49, 85 to 88).Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in some populations of women (51 to 54). However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.In spite of many studies of the relationship between oral contraceptive use and breast and cervical cancers, cause and effect relationship has not been established.4. Hepatic NeoplasiaBenign hepatic adenomas are associated with oral contraceptive use, although the incidence of benign tumors is rare in the United States. Indirect calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3 cases/100,000 for users, risk that increases after four or more years of use (55). Rupture of rare, benign, hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage (56, 57).Studies from Britain have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (58 to 60) in long-term (greater than years) oral contraceptive users. However, these cancers are extremely rare in the U.S., and the attributable risk (the excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral contraceptive users approaches less than one per million users.5. Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis Treatment During clinical trials with the Hepatitis combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as COCs. Discontinue norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets can be restarted approximately weeks following completion of treatment with the combination drug regimen. 6. Ocular LesionsThere have been clinical case reports of retinal thrombosis associated with the use of oral contraceptives.Oral contraceptives should be discontinued if there is unexplained partial or complete loss of vision; onset of proptosis or diplopia; papilledema; or retinal vascular lesions. Appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures should be undertaken immediately.7. Oral Contraceptive Use Before and During Early PregnancyExtensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy (61 to 63). Studies also do not suggest teratogenic effect, particularly insofar as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned (61, 62, 64, 65), when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy.The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as test for pregnancy. Oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.It is recommended that for any patient who has missed two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing oral contraceptive use. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.8. Gallbladder DiseaseEarlier studies have reported an increased lifetime relative risk of gallbladder surgery in users of oral contraceptives and estrogens (66, 67). More recent studies, however, have shown that the relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among oral contraceptive users may be minimal (68 to 70). The recent findings of minimal risk may be related to the use of oral contraceptive formulations containing lower hormonal doses of estrogens and progestogens.9. Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic EffectsOral contraceptives have been shown to cause glucose intolerance in significant percentage of users (23).Oral contraceptives containing greater than 75 mcg of estrogens cause hyperinsulinism, while lower doses of estrogen cause less glucose intolerance (71). Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents (23, 72). However, in the non-diabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose (73). Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully observed while taking oral contraceptives.A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill. As discussed earlier (see WARNINGS 1a. and 1d.), changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive users.10. Elevated Blood PressureAn increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives (74) and this increase is more likely in older oral contraceptive users (75) and with continued use (74). Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners (18) and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestogens.Women with history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases or renal disease (76) should be encouraged to use another method of contraception. If women elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely, and if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should be discontinued. For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives (75), and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension among ever and never users (74,76,77).11. HeadacheThe onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with new pattern which is recurrent, persistent, or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.12. Bleeding IrregularitiesBreakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. Non-hormonal causes should be considered, and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such condition was preexistent.. table.",5a44f7a2-45f1-4d28-b9fb-61d9f2456422,34071-1,WARNINGS SECTION

The different dosage forms of naproxen are bioequivalent in terms of extent of absorption (AUC) and peak concentration (C max); however, the products do differ in their pattern of absorption. These differences between naproxen products are related to both the chemical form of naproxen used and its formulation. Even with the observed differences in pattern of absorption, the elimination half-life of naproxen is unchanged across products ranging from 12 to 17 hours. Steady-state levels of naproxen are reached in to days, and the degree of naproxen accumulation is consistent with this half-life.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Overall, the safety profile of lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets have been studied in over 5,200 subjects in completed clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions for lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets were gastrointestinal events, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and they generally abated over time with continued dosing. In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies where total of 180 and 95 patients with ESRD were randomized to lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets and placebo, respectively, for to weeks of treatment, the most common reactions that were more frequent (>=5% difference) in the lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets group were nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (Table 1).

The safety of lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets was studied in two long-term, open-label clinical trials, which included 1,215 patients treated with lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets and 944 with alternative therapy. Fourteen percent (14%) of patients treated with lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions, such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting were the most common types of event leading to discontinuation. In pooled active comparator controlled clinical trials, hypocalcemia was noted with an incidence of approximately 5% in both lanthanum and active comparator groups. nonclinical study and phase study have shown reduced absorption of calcium in the intestine with lanthanum carbonate treatment.In crossover study in 72 healthy individuals comparing lanthanum chewable tablets to lanthanum oral powder gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting were more common for the oral powder formulation (18%) than for the chewable tablets (7%).. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish causal relationship to drug exposure.

In mice, dose-related increase in the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas was observed at oxcarbazepine doses >= 70 mg/kg/day, which is less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on mg/m2 basis. In rats, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was increased in females treated with oxcarbazepine at doses >=25 mg/kg/day (less than the MRHD on mg/m2 basis), and incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and/or carcinomas were increased in males and females treated with MHD at doses of 600 mg/kg/day (2.4 times the MRHD on mg/m2 basis) and >= 250 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the MRHD on mg/m2 basis), respectively. There was an increase in the incidence of benign testicular interstitial cell tumors in rats at 250 mg oxcarbazepine/kg/day and at >=250 mg MHD/kg/day, and an increase in the incidence of granular cell tumors in the cervix and vagina in rats at 600 mg MHD/kg/day.MutagenesisOxcarbazepine increased mutation frequencies in the in vitro Ames test in the absence of metabolic activation. Both oxcarbazepine and MHD produced increases in chromosomal aberrations and polyploidy in the Chinese hamster ovary assay in vitro in the absence of metabolic activation. MHD was negative in the Ames test, and no mutagenic or clastogenic activity was found with either oxcarbazepine or MHD in V79 Chinese hamster cells in vitro. Oxcarbazepine and MHD were both negative for clastogenic or aneugenic effects (micronucleus formation) in an in vivo rat bone marrow assay.Impairment of FertilityIn study in which male and female rats were administered oxcarbazepine (0, 25, 75 and 150 mg/kg/day) orally prior to and during mating and continuing in females during gestation, no adverse effects on fertility or reproductive performance were observed.

While its mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, ondansetron is not dopamine-receptor antagonist.

It is not certain whether ondansetrons antiemetic action is mediated centrally, peripherally, or in both sites. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to be associated with release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. In humans, urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) excretion increases after cisplatin administration in parallel with the onset of emesis. The released serotonin may stimulate the vagal afferents through the 5-HT receptors and initiate the vomiting reflex.",674ea285-8f84-4603-9655-82200c523fe5,43679-0,MECHANISM OF ACTION SECTION
28679417,"12.3 Pharmacokinetics. Absorption. Following oral administration of 1255 mg/m BID to cancer patients, capecitabine reached peak blood levels in about 1.5 hours (T max) with peak 5-FU levels occurring slightly later, at hours. Food reduced both the rate and extent of absorption of capecitabine with mean max and AUC 0- decreased by 60% and 35%, respectively. The max and AUC 0- of 5-FU were also reduced by food by 43% and 21%, respectively. Food delayed max of both parent and 5-FU by 1.5 hours [see Warnings and Precautions (5), Dosage and Administration (2), and Drug-Food Interaction (7.2)] The pharmacokinetics of capecitabine tablets and its metabolites have been evaluated in about 200 cancer patients over dosage range of 500 to 3500 mg/m 2/day. Over this range, the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine tablets and its metabolite, 5-DFCR were dose proportional and did not change over time. The increases in the AUCs of 5-DFUR and 5-FU, however, were greater than proportional to the increase in dose and the AUC of 5-FU was 34% higher on day 14 than on day 1. The interpatient variability in the max and AUC of 5-FU was greater than 85%. Distribution. Plasma protein binding of capecitabine and its metabolites is less than 60% and is not concentration-dependent. Capecitabine was primarily bound to human albumin (approximately 35%). Capecitabine tablets have low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions related to plasma protein binding. Bioactivation and Metabolism. Capecitabine is extensively metabolized enzymatically to 5-FU. In the liver, 60 kDa carboxylesterase hydrolyzes much of the compound to 5-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5-DFCR). Cytidine deaminase, an enzyme found in most tissues, including tumors, subsequently converts 5-DFCR to 5-DFUR. The enzyme, thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase), then hydrolyzes 5-DFUR to the active drug 5-FU. Many tissues throughout the body express thymidine phosphorylase. Some human carcinomas express this enzyme in higher concentrations than surrounding normal tissues. Following oral administration of capecitabine tablets days before surgery in patients with colorectal cancer, the median ratio of 5-FU concentration in colorectal tumors to adjacent tissues was 2.9 (range from 0.9 to 8.0). These ratios have not been evaluated in breast cancer patients or compared to 5-FU infusion.The enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase hydrogenates 5-FU, the product of capecitabine metabolism, to the much less toxic 5-fluoro-5, 6-dihydro-fluorouracil (FUH 2). Dihydropyrimidinase cleaves the pyrimidine ring to yield 5-fluoro-ureido-propionic acid (FUPA). Finally, -ureido-propionase cleaves FUPA to -fluoro--alanine (FBAL) which is cleared in the urine. In vitro enzymatic studies with human liver microsomes indicated that capecitabine and its metabolites (5-DFUR, 5-DFCR, 5-FU, and FBAL) did not inhibit the metabolism of test substrates by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 3A4, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1. Metabolic Pathway of Capecitabine to 5-FU. Excretion. Capecitabine and its metabolites are predominantly excreted in urine; 95.5% of administered capecitabine dose is recovered in urine. Fecal excretion is minimal (2.6%). The major metabolite excreted in urine is FBAL which represents 57% of the administered dose. About 3% of the administered dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug. The elimination half-life of both parent capecitabine and 5-FU was about 0.75 hour.. Effect of Age, Gender, and Race on the Pharmacokinetics of Capecitabine. population analysis of pooled data from the two large controlled studies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (n 505) who were administered capecitabine tablets at 1250 mg/m twice day indicated that gender (202 females and 303 males) and race (455 white/Caucasian patients, 22 black patients, and 28 patients of other race) have no influence on the pharmacokinetics of 5-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL. Age has no significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of 5-DFUR and 5-FU over the range of 27 to 86 years. 20% increase in age results in 15% increase in AUC of FBAL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)] Following oral administration of 825 mg/m capecitabine twice daily for 14 days, Japanese patients (n 18) had about 36% lower max and 24% lower AUC for capecitabine than the Caucasian patients (n 22). Japanese patients had also about 25% lower max and 34% lower AUC for FBAL than the Caucasian patients. The clinical significance of these differences is unknown. No significant differences occurred in the exposure to other metabolites (5-DFCR, 5-DFUR and 5-FU). Effect of Hepatic Insufficiency. Capecitabine tablets have been evaluated in 13 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases defined by composite score including bilirubin, AST/ALT and alkaline phosphatase following single 1255 mg/m dose of capecitabine tablets. Both AUC 0- and max of capecitabine increased by 60% in patients with hepatic dysfunction compared to patients with normal hepatic function (n 14). The AUC 0- and max of 5-FU were not affected. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases, caution should be exercised when capecitabine tablets are administered. The effect of severe hepatic dysfunction on capecitabine tablets is not known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Special Populations (8.6)]. Effect of Renal Insufficiency. Following oral administration of 1250 mg/m capecitabine twice day to cancer patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, patients with moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 30 mL/min) renal impairment showed 85% and 258% higher systemic exposure to FBAL on day compared to normal renal function patients (creatinine clearance 80 mL/min). Systemic exposure to 5-DFUR was 42% and 71% greater in moderately and severely renal impaired patients, respectively, than in normal patients. Systemic exposure to capecitabine was about 25% greater in both moderately and severely renal impaired patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.5), and Use in Special Populations (8.7)] . Effect of Capecitabine on the Pharmacokinetics of Warfarin. In four patients with cancer, chronic administration of capecitabine (1250 mg/m bid) with single 20 mg dose of warfarin increased the mean AUC of S-warfarin by 57% and decreased its clearance by 37%. Baseline corrected AUC of INR in these patients increased by 2.8-fold, and the maximum observed mean INR value was increased by 91% [see Boxed Warning and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Effect of Antacids on the Pharmacokinetics of Capecitabine. When Maalox (R) (20 mL), an aluminum hydroxide- and magnesium hydroxide-containing antacid, was administered immediately after capecitabine tablets (1250 mg/m 2, = 12 cancer patients), AUC and max increased by 16% and 35%, respectively, for capecitabine and by 18% and 22%, respectively, for 5-DFCR. No effect was observed on the other three major metabolites (5-DFUR, 5-FU, FBAL) of capecitabine tablets. Effect of Allopurinol on Capecitabine. Published literature reported that concomitant use with allopurinol may decrease conversion of capecitabine to the active metabolites, FdUMP and FUTP; however, the clinical significance was not fully characterized.. Effect of Capecitabine on the Pharmacokinetics of Docetaxel and Vice Versa. Phase study evaluated the effect of capecitabine tablets on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (Taxotere (R)) and the effect of docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine tablets was conducted in 26 patients with solid tumors. Capecitabine tablets were found to have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (C max and AUC) and docetaxel has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and the 5-FU precursor 5-DFUR.",16145a4c-a3d0-404b-bd58-3f220a45ef73,43682-4,PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION

Risk SummaryLimited available data with fenofibrate use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of embryo-fetal toxicity was observed with oral administration of fenofibrate in rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses less than or equivalent to the maximum recommended clinical dose of 160 mg daily, based on body surface area (mg/m2). Adverse reproductive outcomes occurred at higher doses in the presence of maternal toxicity (see Data). Fenofibrate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.DataAnimal DataIn pregnant rats given oral dietary doses of 14, 127, and 361 mg/kg/day from gestation day to 15 during the period of organogenesis, no adverse developmental findings were observed at 14 mg/kg/day (less than the clinical exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 300 mg fenofibrate daily, equivalent to 160 mg fenofibrate tablets daily, based on body surface area comparisons). Increased fetal skeletal malformations were observed at maternally toxic doses (361 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 12 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD) that significantly suppressed maternal body weight gain. In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 15, 150, and 300 mg/kg/day from gestation day 618 during the period of organogenesis and allowed to deliver, no adverse developmental findings were observed at 15 mg/kg/day (a dose that approximates the clinical exposure at the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons). Aborted litters were observed at maternally toxic doses (>= 150 mg/kg/day, corresponding to >= 10 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD) that suppressed maternal body weight gain. In pregnant rats given oral dietary doses of 15, 75, and 300 mg/kg/day from gestation day 15 through lactation day 21 (weaning), no adverse developmental effects were observed at 15 mg/kg/day (less than the clinical exposure at the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons), despite maternal toxicity (decreased weight gain). Post-implantation loss was observed at >= 75 mg/kg/day (>= times the clinical exposure at the MRHD) in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased weight gain). Decreased pup survival was noted at 300 mg/kg/day (10 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD), which was associated with decreased maternal body weight gain/maternal neglect.. 8.2 Lactation. Risk Summary There is no available information on the presence of fenofibrate in human milk, effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Fenofibrate is present in the milk of rats, and is therefore likely to be present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, such as disruption of infant lipid metabolism, women should not breastfeed during treatment with fenofibrate tablets and for days after the final dose [see Contraindications (4)].. 8.4 Pediatric Use. Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.. 8.5 Geriatric Use. Fenofibric acid is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Fenofibric acid exposure is not influenced by age. Since elderly patients have higher incidence of renal impairment, dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Elderly patients with normal renal function should require no dose modifications. Consider monitoring renal function in elderly patients taking fenofibrate.. 8.6 Renal Impairment. The use of fenofibrate should be avoided in patients who have severe renal impairment [see Contraindications (4)]. Dose reduction is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitoring renal function in patients with renal impairment is recommended.. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment.

In an 18-month study using doses of about 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day, there were statistically significant increases in benign adenomas of the thyroid and testes and, in male rats, dose-related increase in proliferative changes in the liver (including hepatocytomegaly and hyperplastic nodules). In 24-month studies in which rats were administered doses of about 10, 30, 100, and 150 mg spironolactone tablets/kg/day, the range of proliferative effects included significant increases in hepatocellular adenomas and testicular interstitial cell tumors in males, and significant increases in thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas in both sexes. There was also statistically significant increase in benign uterine endometrial stromal polyps in females. MutagenesisNeither spironolactone tablets nor potassium canrenoate produced mutagenic effects in tests using bacteria or yeast. In the absence of metabolic activation, neither spironolactone tablets nor potassium canrenoate has been shown to be mutagenic in mammalian tests in vitro. In the presence of metabolic activation, spironolactone tablets has been reported to be negative in some mammalian mutagenicity tests in vitro and inconclusive (but slightly positive) for mutagenicity in other mammalian tests in vitro. In the presence of metabolic activation, potassium canrenoate has been reported to test positive for mutagenicity in some mammalian tests in vitro, inconclusive in others, and negative in still others. Impairment of FertilityIn three-litter reproduction study in which female rats received dietary doses of 15 and 50 mg spironolactone tablets/kg/day, there were no effects on mating and fertility, but there was small increase in incidence of stillborn pups at 50 mg/kg/day. When injected into female rats (100 mg/kg/day for days, i.p.), spironolactone tablets were found to increase the length of the estrous cycle by prolonging diestrus during treatment and inducing constant diestrus during two-week post-treatment observation period. These effects were associated with retarded ovarian follicle development and reduction in circulating estrogen levels, which would be expected to impair mating, fertility, and fecundity. Spironolactone tablets (100 mg/kg/day), administered i.p. to female mice during two-week cohabitation period with untreated males, decreased the number of mated mice that conceived (effect shown to be caused by an inhibition of ovulation) and decreased the number of implanted embryos in those that became pregnant (effect shown to be caused by an inhibition of implantation), and at 200 mg/kg, also increased the latency period to mating.",416ce231-fc8d-4ba0-a1ce-d5e054cf025e,43680-8,NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY SECTION

28604389,"8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure RegistryThere will be pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to semaglutide during pregnancy. Pregnant women exposed to WEGOVY and healthcare providers are encouraged to contact Novo Nordisk at 1-800-727-6500.Risk SummaryBased on animal reproduction studies, there may be potential risks to the fetus from exposure to semaglutide during pregnancy. Additionally, weight loss offers no benefit to pregnant patient and may cause fetal harm. When pregnancy is recognized, advise the pregnant patient of the risk to fetus, and discontinue WEGOVY (see Clinical Considerations). Available pharmacovigilance data and data from clinical trials with WEGOVY use in pregnant patients are insufficient to establish drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.In pregnant rats administered semaglutide during organogenesis, embryofetal mortality, structural abnormalities and alterations to growth occurred at maternal exposures below the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on AUC. In rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys administered semaglutide during organogenesis, early pregnancy losses and structural abnormalities were observed at below the MRHD (rabbit) and greater than or equal to 2-fold the MRHD (monkey). These findings coincided with marked maternal body weight loss in both animal species (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal riskAppropriate weight gain based on pre-pregnancy weight is currently recommended for all pregnant patients, including those who already have overweight or obesity, because of the obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. DataAnimal DataIn combined fertility and embryofetal development study in rats, subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.03 and 0.09 mg/kg/day (0.04-, 0.1-, and 0.4-fold the MRHD) were administered to males for weeks prior to and throughout mating and to females for weeks prior to mating, and throughout organogenesis to Gestation Day 17. In parental animals, pharmacologically mediated reductions in body weight gain and food consumption were observed at all dose levels. In the offspring, reduced growth and fetuses with visceral (heart blood vessels) and skeletal (cranial bones, vertebra, ribs) abnormalities were observed at the human exposure. In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits, subcutaneous doses of 0.0010, 0.0025 or 0.0075 mg/kg/day (0.01-, 0.1-, and 0.9-fold the MRHD) were administered throughout organogenesis from Gestation Day to 19. Pharmacologically mediated reductions in maternal body weight gain and food consumption were observed at all dose levels. Early pregnancy losses and increased incidences of minor visceral (kidney, liver) and skeletal (sternebra) fetal abnormalities were observed at greater than or equal to 0.0025 mg/kg/day, at clinically relevant exposures. In an embryofetal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses of 0.015, 0.075, and 0.15 mg/kg twice weekly (0.4-, 2-, and 6-fold the MRHD) were administered throughout organogenesis, from Gestation Day 16 to 50. Pharmacologically mediated, marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with the occurrence of sporadic abnormalities (vertebra, sternebra, ribs) at greater than or equal to 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (greater than or equal to times human exposure). In pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses of 0.015, 0.075, and 0.15 mg/kg twice weekly (0.2-, 1-, and 3-fold the MRHD) were administered from Gestation Day 16 to 140. Pharmacologically mediated marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with an increase in early pregnancy losses and led to delivery of slightly smaller offspring at greater than or equal to 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (greater than or equal to time human exposure).",f5e548d0-cc79-4c34-a3f5-e20a5b8b6564,42228-7,PREGNANCY SECTION

28651729,"Pediatric Use. The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients years of age and older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). The safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets were studied in 30 children in 24-week, openlabel trial. Patients were aged 5-15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from mg to 15 mg, treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with Oxybutynin Chloride Tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm 2O to 33 cm 2O, and reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm 2O) from 39% to 20%.

28668991,"Geriatric Use Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects (see WARNINGS; Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events, Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation, Hepatotoxicity, Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia, PRECAUTIONS; Laboratory Monitoring). Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly, it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose.Experience indicates that geriatric patients may be particularly sensitive to certain adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Elderly or debilitated patients seem to tolerate peptic ulceration or bleeding less well when these events do occur. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in the geriatric population (see WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation). Naproxen is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Geriatric patients may be at greater risk for the development of form of renal toxicity precipitated by reduced prostaglandin formation during administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see WARNINGS: Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia).",5de3af7c-2c77-6b04-e053-2991aa0ae3fa,34082-8,GERIATRIC USE SECTION

28858379,"12.3 Pharmacokinetics. Absorption: After single oral-dose administration of 801 mg pirfenidone (three 267 mg capsules), the maximum observed plasma concentration (C max) was achieved between 30 minutes and hours (median time of 0.5 hours). Food decreased the rate and extent of absorption. Median max increased from 0.5 hours to hours with food. Maximum plasma concentrations (C max) and AUC to inf decreased by approximately 49% and 16% with food, respectively. Bioequivalence was demonstrated in the fasted state when comparing the 801 mg tablet to three 267 mg capsules. The effect of food on pirfenidone exposure was consistent between the tablet and capsule formulations. reduced incidence of adverse reactions was observed in the fed group when compared to the fasted group. In controlled studies with IPF patients, pirfenidone was taken with food [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Clinical Studies (14)]. The absolute bioavailability of pirfenidone has not been determined in humans. Distribution: Pirfenidone binds to human plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin, in concentration-independent manner over the range of concentrations observed in clinical trials. The overall mean binding was 58% at concentrations observed in clinical studies (1 to 10 mcg/mL). Mean apparent oral volume of distribution is approximately 59 to 71 liters. Metabolism: In vitro profiling studies in hepatocytes and liver microsomes have shown that pirfenidone is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP1A2 and multiple other CYPs (CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1). Oral administration of pirfenidone results in the formation of four metabolites. In humans, only pirfenidone and 5-carboxy-pirfenidone are present in plasma in significant quantities. The mean metabolite-to-parent ratio ranged from approximately 0.6 to 0.7. No formal radiolabeled studies have assessed the metabolism of pirfenidone in humans. In vitro data suggests that metabolites are not expected to be pharmacologically active at observed metabolite concentrations. Elimination: The mean terminal half-life is approximately hours in healthy subjects. Pirfenidone is excreted predominantly as metabolite 5-carboxy-pirfenidone, mainly in the urine (approximately 80% of the dose). The majority of pirfenidone was excreted as the 5-carboxy metabolite (approximately 99.6% of that recovered). Specific Populations: Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone and the 5-carboxy-pirfenidone metabolite were studied in 12 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class B) and in 12 subjects with normal hepatic function. Results showed that the mean exposure, AUC to inf and max of pirfenidone increased approximately 1.6- and approximately 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, respectively. The exposure of 5-carboxy-pirfenidone did not change significantly in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone and the 5-carboxy-pirfenidone metabolite were studied in 18 subjects with mild (CL cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (CLcr 30 to 50 mL/min), and severe (CLcr less than 30 mL/min) renal impairment (n=6/group) and in subjects with normal CL cr (greater than or equal to 80 mL/min) renal function. Results showed that systemic exposure (AUC to inf to pirfenidone increased approximately 1.4, 1.5, and 1.2-fold in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. The corresponding AUC to inf of 5-carboxy-pirfenidone increased 1.7, 3.4, and 5.6-fold, although the change in the patients with mild renal impairment was not statistically significant. The renal clearance of 5-carboxy-pirfenidone decreased significantly in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. The pharmacokinetics and safety of pirfenidone has not been studied in subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. Geriatric Results of population pharmacokinetic analysis suggest that no dosage adjustment is needed in geriatric patients. Gender Results of population pharmacokinetic analysis of pirfenidone showed no significant differences in pharmacokinetics between males and females. Obesity Results of population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that obesity (Body Mass Index [BMI] greater than or equal to 30 kg/m 2) has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone. Race Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that race has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone. Drug Interaction Studies: Cytochrome P450 1A2 Inhibitors Pirfenidone is substrate of cytochrome P450 1A2. In single-dose drug interaction study in 25 healthy nonsmokers and 25 smokers, pirfenidone was coadministered with fluvoxamine (50 mg at bedtime for days; 50 mg twice day for days, and 50 mg in the morning and 100 mg at bedtime for days). An approximately 4-fold increase in exposure to pirfenidone in nonsmokers and approximately 7-fold increase in exposure in smokers was observed. In single-dose drug interaction study in 27 healthy subjects, coadministration of 801 mg of pirfenidone and 750 mg of ciprofloxacin (a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2) on Day (ciprofloxacin was dosed at 750 mg twice daily from Day to Day 7) increased the exposure to pirfenidone by 81%. Cytochrome P450 1A2 Inducers Following single oral dose of 801 mg pirfenidone in 25 smokers and 25 healthy nonsmokers, the systemic exposure in smokers was significantly lower compared to nonsmokers. AUC to inf and max of pirfenidone in smokers were 46% and 68% of those in nonsmokers, respectively. Inhibitory Effect of Pirfenidone on P-glycoprotein (Pgp) The potential for pirfenidone to inhibit Pgp mediated transport of digoxin (5.0 uM) was evaluated in the absence and presence of pirfenidone at concentrations ranging from to 1,000 uM in in vitro system. Pirfenidone showed weak inhibition (10 to 30%) of Pgp facilitated digoxin B-A efflux at concentrations of 100 uM and above. Effect of pirfenidone upon Pgp substrate pharmacokinetics and safety has not been evaluated in humans. Inhibitory Effect of Pirfenidone on CYP2C9, 2C19 or 1A2, 2D6, 3A4 The potential for pirfenidone to inhibit CYP2C9, 2C19 or 1A2 was evaluated in vitro at concentrations up to 1,000 uM (approximately 10-fold the mean human max). Pirfenidone showed concentration-dependent inhibition on CYP2C9, 2C19 or 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. At 1,000 uM, pirfenidone inhibits the activity of these enzymes by 30.4%, 27.5%, 34.1%, 21%, and 9.6%, respectively. Effect of pirfenidone upon pharmacokinetics and safety of CYP2C9, 2C19, 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4 substrates has not been evaluated in humans.",a7f3485e-9dcc-45db-9b9c-74c70e22c4bb,43682-4,PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION

28381240,"14 CLINICAL STUDIES. 14.1Postherpetic Neuralgia. Gabapentin was evaluated for the management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of total of 563 patients with pain for more than months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash (Table 6).Table 6.

Patients initiated treatment with titration to maximum of 900 mg/day gabapentin over days. Dosages were then to be titrated in 600 to 1200 mg/day increments at 3- to 7-day intervals to the target dose over to weeks. Patients recorded their pain in daily diary using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale ranging from (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). mean pain score during baseline of at least was required for randomization. Analyses were conducted using the ITT population (all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication).Both studies demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo at all doses tested.The reduction in weekly mean pain scores was seen by Week in both studies, and were maintained to the end of treatment. Comparable treatment effects were observed in all active treatment arms. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling provided confirmatory evidence of efficacy across all doses.

Proportion of Responders (patients with >=50% reduction in pain score) at Endpoint: Controlled PHN Studies. Figure 1. Figure 2. Figure 3. 14.2Epilepsy for Partial Onset Seizures (Adjunctive Therapy). The effectiveness of gabapentin as adjunctive therapy (added to other antiepileptic drugs) was established in multicenter placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients (3 years and older) with refractory partial seizures.Evidence of effectiveness was obtained in three trials conducted in 705 patients (age 12 years and above) and one trial conducted in 247 pediatric patients (3 to 12 years of age). The patients enrolled had history of at least partial seizures per month in spite of receiving one or more antiepileptic drugs at therapeutic levels and were observed on their established antiepileptic drug regimen during 12-week baseline period (6 weeks in the study of pediatric patients). In patients continuing to have at least (or in some studies) seizures per month, gabapentin or placebo was then added on to the existing therapy during 12-week treatment period. Effectiveness was assessed primarily on the basis of the percent of patients with 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency from baseline to treatment (the responder rate) and derived measure called response ratio, measure of change defined as (T B)/(T B), in which is the patients baseline seizure frequency and is the patients seizure frequency during treatment. Response ratio is distributed within the range -1 to +1. zero value indicates no change while complete elimination of seizures would give value of -1; increased seizure rates would give positive values. response ratio of -0.33 corresponds to 50% reduction in seizure frequency. The results given below are for all partial seizures in the intent-to-treat (all patients who received any doses of treatment) population in each study, unless otherwise indicated.One study compared gabapentin 1200 mg/day, in three divided doses with placebo. Responder rate was 23% (14/61) in the gabapentin group and 9% (6/66) in the placebo group; the difference between groups was statistically significant. Response ratio was also better in the gabapentin group (-0.199) than in the placebo group (-0.044), difference that also achieved statistical significance.A second study compared primarily gabapentin 1200 mg/day, in three divided doses (N=101), with placebo (N=98). Additional smaller gabapentin dosage groups (600 mg/day, N=53; 1800 mg/day, N=54) were also studied for information regarding dose response. Responder rate was higher in the gabapentin 1200 mg/day group (16%) than in the placebo group (8%), but the difference was not statistically significant. The responder rate at 600 mg (17%) was also not significantly higher than in the placebo, but the responder rate in the 1800 mg group (26%) was statistically significantly superior to the placebo rate. Response ratio was better in the gabapentin 1200 mg/day group (-0.103) than in the placebo group (-0.022); but this difference was also not statistically significant (p 0.224). better response was seen in the gabapentin 600 mg/day group (-0.105) and 1800 mg/day group (-0.222) than in the 1200 mg/day group, with the 1800 mg/day group achieving statistical significance compared to the placebo group.A third study compared gabapentin 900 mg/day, in three divided doses (N=111), and placebo (N=109). An additional gabapentin 1200 mg/day dosage group (N=52) provided dose-response data. statistically significant difference in responder rate was seen in the gabapentin 900 mg/day group (22%) compared to that in the placebo group (10%). Response ratio was also statistically significantly superior in the gabapentin 900 mg/day group (-0.119) compared to that in the placebo group (-0.027), as was response ratio in 1200 mg/day gabapentin (-0.184) compared to placebo.Analyses were also performed in each study to examine the effect of gabapentin on preventing secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Patients who experienced secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizure in either the baseline or in the treatment period in all three placebo-controlled studies were included in these analyses. There were several response ratio comparisons that showed statistically significant advantage for gabapentin compared to placebo and favorable trends for almost all comparisons.Analysis of responder rate using combined data from all three studies and all doses (N=162, gabapentin; N=89, placebo) also showed significant advantage for gabapentin over placebo in reducing the frequency of secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures.In two of the three controlled studies, more than one dose of gabapentin was used. Within each study, the results did not show consistently increased response to dose. However, looking across studies, trend toward increasing efficacy with increasing dose is evident (see Figure 4). Figure 4. Responder Rate in Patients Receiving Gabapentin Expressed as Difference from Placebo by Dose and Study: Adjunctive Therapy Studies in Patients >=12 Years of Age with Partial SeizuresIn the figure, treatment effect magnitude, measured on the axis in terms of the difference in the proportion of gabapentin and placebo-assigned patients attaining 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency from baseline, is plotted against the daily dose of gabapentin administered (X axis).Although no formal analysis by gender has been performed, estimates of response (Response Ratio) derived from clinical trials (398 men, 307 women) indicate no important gender differences exist. There was no consistent pattern indicating that age had any effect on the response to gabapentin. There were insufficient numbers of patients of races other than Caucasian to permit comparison of efficacy among racial groups.A fourth study in pediatric patients age to 12 years compared 25 -35 mg/kg/day gabapentin (N=118) with placebo (N=127). For all partial seizures in the intent-to-treat population, the response ratio was statistically significantly better for the gabapentin group (-0.146) than for the placebo group (-0.079). For the same population, the responder rate for gabapentin (21%) was not significantly different from placebo (18%).A study in pediatric patients age month to years compared 40 mg/kg/day gabapentin (N=38) with placebo (N=38) in patients who were receiving at least one marketed antiepileptic drug and had at least one partial seizure during the screening period (within weeks prior to baseline). Patients had up to 48 hours of baseline and up to 72 hours of double-blind video EEG monitoring to record and count the occurrence of seizures. There were no statistically significant differences between treatments in either the response ratio or responder rate..

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dosage over period of - weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly reinstate metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physicians advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in patients treated only for hypertension.. 5.2 Heart Failure. Worsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets [see Dosage and Administration 2)] It may be necessary to lower the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. 5.3 Bronchospastic Disease. PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD, IN GENERAL, NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. Because of its relative beta cardio-selectivity, however, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta 1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. Bronchodilators, including beta 2-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly [see Dosage and Administration 2)] . 5.4 Pheochromocytoma. If metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.. 5.5 Major Surgery. Avoid initiation of high-dose regimen of extended-release metoprolol in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, since such use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, stroke and death. Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery, however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.. 5.6 Diabetes and Hypoglycemia. Beta-blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. 5.7 Hepatic Impairment. Consider initiating metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets therapy at doses lower than those recommended for given indication; gradually increase dosage to optimize therapy, while monitoring closely for adverse events. 5.8 Thyrotoxicosis. Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade may precipitate thyroid storm.. 5.9 Anaphylactic Reaction. While taking beta-blockers, patients with history of severe anaphylactic reactions to variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat an allergic reaction.. 5.10 Peripheral Vascular Disease. Beta-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. 5.11 Calcium Channel Blockers. Because of significant inotropic and chronotropic effects in patients treated with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers of the verapamil and diltiazem type, caution should be exercised in patients treated with these agents concomitantly.",3516165d-adb2-4dbe-b672-13f7b989d5ed,43685-7,WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION

Application of lidocaine and prilocaine cream to larger areas or for longer times than those recommended could result in sufficient absorption of lidocaine and prilocaine resulting in serious adverse effects (see Individualization of Dose).Patients treated with class III anti-arrhythmic drugs (e.g., amiodarone, bretylium, sotalol, dofetilide) should be under close surveillance and ECG monitoring considered, because cardiac effects may be additive.Studies in laboratory animals (guinea pigs) have shown that lidocaine and prilocaine cream has an ototoxic effect when instilled into the middle ear. In these same studies, animals exposed to lidocaine and prilocaine cream only in the external auditory canal, showed no abnormality. Lidocaine and prilocaine cream should not be used in any clinical situation when its penetration or migration beyond the tympanic membrane into the middle ear is possible.. Methemoglobinemia. Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use. Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, infants under months of age, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition. If local anesthetics must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended.Signs of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure and are characterized by cyanotic skin discoloration and/or abnormal coloration of the blood. Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects, including seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death. Discontinue lidocaine and prilocaine cream and any other oxidizing agents. Depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms, patients may respond to supportive care, i.e., oxygen therapy, hydration. more severe clinical presentation may require treatment with methylene blue, exchange transfusion, or hyperbaric oxygen.",973d188e-8e96-4e7d-b94f-0349ca19cfe8,34071-1,WARNINGS SECTION

28069435,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. Bisoprolol is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 2.5 to 40 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In clinical trials of bisoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using bisoprolol doses of 2.5 to 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing doses of either component.The adverse effects (see WARNINGS) of bisoprolol are mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily bradycardia, diarrhea, asthenia, and fatigue) and dose-independent phenomena (eg, occasional rash); those of hydrochlorothiazide are mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (eg, possibly pancreatitis); the dose-dependent phenomena for each being much more common than the dose-independent phenomena. The latter consist of those few that are truly idiosyncratic in nature or those that occur with such low frequency that dose relationship may be difficult to discern. Therapy with combination of bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent adverse effects, and to minimize these, it may be appropriate to begin combination therapy only after patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. On the other hand, regimens that combine low doses of bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide should produce minimal dose-dependent adverse effects, eg, bradycardia, diarrhea, asthenia and fatigue, and minimal dose-dependent adverse metabolic effects, ie, decreases in serum potassium (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).. Therapy Guided by Clinical Effect. patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with 2.5-20 mg bisoprolol daily may instead be given ZIAC. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar blood pressure control without electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to ZIAC.. Initial Therapy. Antihypertensive therapy may be initiated with the lowest dose of ZIAC, one 2.5/6.25 mg tablet once daily. Subsequent titration (14 day intervals) may be carried out with ZIAC tablets up to the maximum recommended dose 20/12.5 mg (two 10/6.25 mg tablets) once daily, as appropriate.. Replacement Therapy. The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components.. Cessation of Therapy. If withdrawal of ZIAC therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually over period of about weeks. Patients should be carefully observed.Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: As noted in the WARNINGS section, caution must be used in dosing/titrating patients with hepatic impairment or renal dysfunction. Since there is no indication that hydrochlorothiazide is dialyzable, and limited data suggest that bisoprolol is not dialyzable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis.Geriatric Patients: Dosage adjustment on the basis of age is not usually necessary, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction (see above and WARNINGS section).Pediatric Patients: There is no pediatric experience with ZIAC.",238176e5-df10-457b-a5cf-c950a583e748,34068-7,DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION SECTION

28137941,"12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. 12.1 Mechanism of Action. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed on the cell surface of both normal and cancer cells. In some tumor cells signaling through this receptor plays role in tumor cell survival and proliferation irrespective of EGFR mutation status. Erlotinib reversibly inhibits the kinase activity of EGFR, preventing autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues associated with the receptor and thereby inhibiting further downstream signaling. Erlotinib binding affinity for EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) mutations is higher than its affinity for the wild type receptor. Erlotinib inhibition of other tyrosine kinase receptors has not been fully characterized.. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics. Absorption. Erlotinib is about 60% absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma levels occur hours after dosing. Effect of Food. Food increased the bioavailability of erlotinib to approximately 100%.. Distribution:. Erlotinib is 93% protein bound to plasma albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG). Erlotinib has an apparent volume of distribution of 232 liters.. Elimination. Erlotinib is eliminated with median half-life of 36.2 hours in patients receiving the single-agent erlotinib tablets 2nd/3rd line regimen. Time to reach steady state plasma concentration would therefore be 7-8 days.. Metabolism. Erlotinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and to lesser extent by CYP1A2, and the extrahepatic isoform CYP1A1, in vitro.. Excretion. Following 100 mg oral dose, 91% of the dose was recovered: 83% in feces (1% of the dose as intact parent) and 8% in urine (0.3% of the dose as intact parent).. Specific Populations. Neither age, body weight, nor gender had clinically significant effect on the systemic exposure of nd rd erlotinib in NSCLC patients receiving single-agent erlotinib tablets for 2nd /3rd line treatment or for maintenance treatment, and in pancreatic cancer patients who received erlotinib plus gemcitabine. The pharmacokinetics of erlotinib tablets in patients with compromised renal function is unknown.. Patients with Hepatic Impairment. In vitro and in vivo evidence suggest that erlotinib is cleared primarily by the liver. However, erlotinib exposure was similar in patients with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh B) compared with patients with adequate hepatic function including patients with primary liver cancer or hepatic metastases. Patients That Smoke Tobacco Cigarettes. In single-dose pharmacokinetics trial in healthy volunteers, cigarette smoking (moderate CYP1A2 inducer) increased erlotinib clearance and decreased erlotinib AUC0-inf by 64% (95% CI, 46-76%) in current smokers compared with former/never smokers. In NSCLC trial, current smokers achieved erlotinib steady-state trough plasma concentrations which were approximately 2-fold less than the former smokers or patients who had never smoked. This effect was accompanied by 24% increase in apparent erlotinib plasma clearance. In another study which was conducted in NSCLC patients who were current smokers, pharmacokinetic analyses at steady-state indicated dose-proportional increase in erlotinib exposure when the erlotinib tablets dose was increased from 150 mg to 300 mg. [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Interactions (7) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].. Drug Interaction Studies. Co-administration of gemcitabine had no effect on erlotinib plasma clearance.. CYP3A4 Inhibitors. Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, increased erlotinib AUC by 67%.Co-administration with combined CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitor, ciprofloxacin, increased erlotinib exposure [AUC] by 39%, and increased erlotinib maximum concentration [Cmax] by 17%. [see Dose Modifications (2.4), Drug Interactions (7)].. CYP3A4 Inducers. Pre-treatment with the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin, for 7-11 days prior to erlotinib tablets, decreased erlotinib AUC by 58% to 80% [see Dose Modifications (2.4), Drug Interactions (7)].. CYP1A2 Inducers or Smoking Tobacco. See Specific Populations Section [see Dose Modifications (2.4), Drug Interactions (7)]. Drugs that Increase Gastric pH. Erlotinib solubility is pH dependent and decreases as pH increases. When proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) was co-administered with erlotinib tablets the erlotinib exposure [AUC] was decreased by 46% and the erlotinib maximum concentration [Cmax] was decreased by 61%. When erlotinib tablets was administered hours following 300 mg dose of an H-2 receptor antagonist (ranitidine), the erlotinib AUC was reduced by 33% and the erlotinib Cmax was reduced by 54%. When erlotinib tablets was administered with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily (at least 10 after the previous ranitidine evening dose and h before the ranitidine morning dose), the erlotinib AUC was decreased by 15% and the erlotinib Cmax was decreased by 17% [see Dose Modifications (2.4), Drug Interactions (7)].",2c4c7353-b81c-4651-8aac-6d15e88145af,34090-1,CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION

Manage the handling of Lazanda to minimize the risk of abuse, including restriction of access and accounting procedures as appropriate to the clinical setting and as required by law [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2)].Concerns about abuse and addiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. However, all patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.Addiction is primary, chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Drug addiction is treatable disease, utilizing multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. Drug-seeking behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers.Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction and is characterized by misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Since Lazanda may be abused or diverted for nonmedical use, careful record keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of patients, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.Contact your State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.",39531d0c-db12-4627-81c9-6563076b637b,34086-9,ABUSE SECTION

CYP2B6 inducers: Dose increase may be necessary if coadministered with CYP2B6 inducers (e.g., ritonavir, lopinavir, efavirenz, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) based on clinical exposure, but should not exceed the maximum recommended dose. 7.1) Drugs metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants (e.g., venlafaxine, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide). Consider dose reduction when using with bupropion. 7.2) Drugs that lower seizure threshold: Dose bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) with caution. 5.3, 7.3) Dopaminergic Drugs (levodopa and amantadine): CNS toxicity can occur when used concomitantly with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL). 7.4) MAOIs: Increased risk of hypertensive reactions can occur when used concomitantly with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL). 7.6) Drug-laboratory test interactions: Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) can cause false-positive urine test results for amphetamines. 7.7) CYP2B6 inducers: Dose increase may be necessary if coadministered with CYP2B6 inducers (e.g., ritonavir, lopinavir, efavirenz, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) based on clinical exposure, but should not exceed the maximum recommended dose. 7.1) Drugs metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants (e.g., venlafaxine, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide). Consider dose reduction when using with bupropion. 7.2) Drugs that lower seizure threshold: Dose bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) with caution. 5.3, 7.3) Dopaminergic Drugs (levodopa and amantadine): CNS toxicity can occur when used concomitantly with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL). 7.4) MAOIs: Increased risk of hypertensive reactions can occur when used concomitantly with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL). 7.6) Drug-laboratory test interactions: Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) can cause false-positive urine test results for amphetamines. 7.7) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (XL). Bupropion is primarily metabolized to hydroxybupropion by CYP2B6. Therefore, the potential exists for drug interactions between bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) and drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP2B6.Inhibitors of CYP2B6Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposures but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure. Based on clinical response, dosage adjustment of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) may be necessary when coadministered with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Inducers of CYP2B6Ritonavir, Lopinavir, and Efavirenz: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can decrease bupropion and hydroxybupropion exposure. Dosage increase of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) may be necessary when coadministered with ritonavir, lopinavir, or efavirenz but should not exceed the maximum recommended dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin: While not systemically studied, these drugs may induce metabolism of bupropion and may decrease bupropion exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] If bupropion is used concomitantly with CYP inducer, it may be necessary to increase the dose of bupropion, but the maximum recommended dose should not be exceeded. 7.2 Potential for Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (XL) to Affect Other Drugs. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6Bupropion and its metabolites (erythrohydrobupropion, threohydrobupropion, hydroxybupropion) are CYP2D6 inhibitors. Therefore, coadministration of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase the exposures of drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6. Such drugs include certain antidepressants (e.g., venlafaxine, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, risperidone, and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g. propafenone, and flecainide). When used concomitantly with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL), it may be necessary to decrease the dose of these CYP2D6 substrates, particularly for drugs with narrow therapeutic index. Drugs that require metabolic activation by CYP2D6 to be effective (e.g., tamoxifen), theoretically could have reduced efficacy when administered concomitantly with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as bupropion. Patients treated concomitantly with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) and such drugs may require increased doses of the drug [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.3 Drugs That Lower Seizure Threshold. Use extreme caution when coadministering bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) with other drugs that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, antidepressants, theophylline, or systemic corticosteroids). Use low initial doses of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) and increase the dose gradually [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . 7.4 Dopaminergic Drugs (Levodopa and Amantadine) Bupropion, levodopa, and amantadine have dopamine agonist effects. CNS toxicity has been reported when bupropion was coadministered with levodopa or amantadine. Adverse reactions have included restlessness, agitation, tremor, ataxia, gait disturbance, vertigo, and dizziness. It is presumed that the toxicity results from cumulative dopamine agonist effects. Use caution when administering bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) concomitantly with these drugs . 7.5Use with Alcohol In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced alcohol tolerance in patients who were drinking alcohol during treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL). The consumption of alcohol during treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) should be minimized or avoided . 7.6MAO Inhibitors. Bupropion inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. Concomitant use of MAOIs and bupropion is contraindicated because there is an increased risk of hypertensive reactions if bupropion is used concomitantly with MAOIs. Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAO inhibitor phenelzine. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat depression and initiation of treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL). Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) before starting an MAOI antidepressant see Dosage and Administration (2.8, 2.9) and Contraindications (4)] . 7.7 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for amphetamines have been reported in patients taking bupropion. This is due to lack of specificity of some screening tests. False-positive test results may result even following discontinuation of bupropion therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish bupropion from amphetamines.",96e78f74-fad0-4ae1-9e68-55e4c6ab2d60,34073-7,DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION

Recommended starting dose: mg; dose can be repeated at to hour intervals, up to maximum of doses in 24 hours (2.1). Dosage can be increased by mg to mg per dose, wHh to days between increases; total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg (2.1). Tizanidine pharmacokinetics differs between tablets and capsules, and when taken with or without food. These differences could result in change in tolerability and control of symptoms (2.1, 12.3). To discontinue tizanidine, decrease dose slowly to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia (2.2). 2.1 Dosing lnformation. Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules may be prescribed with or without food. Once the formulation has been selected and the decision to take with or without food has been made, this regimen should not be altered. Food has complex effects on tizanidine pharmacokinetics, which differ with the different formulations. Tizanidine hydrochloride capsules and tizanidine hydrochloride tablets are bioequivalent to each other under fasting conditions (more than hours after meal), but not under fed conditions (within 30 minutes of meal). These pharmacokinetic differences may result in clinically significant differences when switching administration of tablet and capsules and when switching administration between the fed or fasted state.These changes may result in increased adverse events, or delayed or more rapid onset of activity, depending upon the nature of the switch. For this reason, the prescriber should be thoroughly familiar with the changes in kinetics associated with these different conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].The recommended starting dose is mg. Because the effect of tizanidine peaks at approximately to hours post-dose and dissipates between to hours post-dose, treatment can be repeated at to hour intervals, as needed, to maximum of three doses in 24 hours.Dosage can be gradually increased by mg to mg at each dose, with to days between dosage increases, until satisfactory reduction of muscle tone is achieved. The total daily dose should not exceed 36 mg. Single doses greater than 16 mg have not been studied.. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 25 ml/min), as clearance is reduced by more than 50%. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. 11 higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 7)].. 2.3 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment. Tizanidine should be used with caution in patients with any hepatic impairment. In these patients, during titration, the individual doses should be reduced. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended for baseline and month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected. [see Use in Specific Populations (8. 7)].. 2.4 Drug Discontinuation. If therapy needs to be discontinued, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses (20 mg to 36 mg daily) for long periods (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the dose should be decreased slowly (2 mg to mg per day) to minimize the risk of withdrawal and rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].",c235e85a-8f43-4b68-b357-2938ddc78fe9,34068-7,DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION SECTION

28958254,"12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. 12.1 Mechanism of Action. The precise mechanisms by which topiramate exerts its anticonvulsant and preventive migraine effects are unknown; however, preclinical studies have revealed four properties that may contribute to topiramates efficacy for epilepsy and the preventive treatment of migraine. Electrophysiological and biochemical evidence suggests that topiramate, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels, augments the activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyrate at some subtypes of the GABA-A receptor, antagonizes the AMPA/kainate subtype of the glutamate receptor, and inhibits the carbonic anhydrase enzyme, particularly isozymes II and IV.. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics. Topiramate has anticonvulsant activity in rat and mouse maximal electroshock seizure (MES) tests. Topiramate is only weakly effective in blocking clonic seizures induced by the GABAA receptor antagonist, pentylenetetrazole. Topiramate is also effective in rodent models of epilepsy, which include tonic and absence-like seizures in the spontaneous epileptic rat (SER) and tonic and clonic seizures induced in rats by kindling of the amygdala or by global ischemia.Changes (increases and decreases) from baseline in vital signs (systolic blood pressure-SBP, diastolic blood pressure-DBP, pulse) occurred more frequently in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) treated with various daily doses of topiramate (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, to mg/kg) than in patients treated with placebo in controlled trials for the preventive treatment of migraine. The most notable changes were SBP 90 mm Hg, DBP 50 mm Hg, SBP or DBP increases or decreases >= 20 mm Hg, and pulse increases or decreases >= 30 beats per minute. These changes were often dose-related, and were most frequently associated with the greatest treatment difference at the 200 mg dose level. Systematic collection of orthostatic vital signs has not been conducted. The clinical significance of these various changes in vital signs has not been clearly established.. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics. The sprinkle formulation is bioequivalent to the immediate-release tablet formulation and, therefore, may be substituted as therapeutic equivalent. Absorption of topiramate is rapid, with peak plasma concentrations occurring at approximately hours following 400 mg oral dose. The relative bioavailability of topiramate from the tablet formulation is about 80% compared to solution. The bioavailability of topiramate is not affected by food. The pharmacokinetics of topiramate are linear with dose proportional increases in plasma concentration over the dose range studied (200 to 800 mg/day). The mean plasma elimination half-life is 21 hours after single or multiple doses. Steady-state is thus reached in about days in patients with normal renal function. Topiramate is 15% to 41% bound to human plasma proteins over the blood concentration range of 0.5 to 250 mcg/mL. The fraction bound decreased as blood concentration increased. Carbamazepine and phenytoin do not alter the binding of topiramate. Sodium valproate, at 500 mcg/mL (a concentration to 10 times higher than considered therapeutic for valproate) decreased the protein binding of topiramate from 23% to 13%. Topiramate does not influence the binding of sodium valproate. Metabolism and Excretion Topiramate is not extensively metabolized and is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine (approximately 70% of an administered dose). Six metabolites have been identified in humans, none of which constitutes more than 5% of an administered dose. The metabolites are formed via hydroxylation, hydrolysis, and glucuronidation. There is evidence of renal tubular reabsorption of topiramate. In rats, given probenecid to inhibit tubular reabsorption, along with topiramate, significant increase in renal clearance of topiramate was observed. This interaction has not been evaluated in humans. Overall, oral plasma clearance (CL/F) is approximately 20 to 30 mL/min in adults following oral administration.Specific PopulationsRenal Impairment The clearance of topiramate was reduced by 42% in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 69 mL/min/1.73 m2) and by 54% in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared to subjects with normal renal function (creatinine clearance >70 mL/min/1.73 m2) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and (2.5)]. Hemodialysis Topiramate is cleared by hemodialysis. Using high-efficiency, counterflow, single pass-dialysate hemodialysis procedure, topiramate dialysis clearance was 120 mL/min with blood flow through the dialyzer at 400 mL/min. This high clearance (compared to 20 to 30 mL/min total oral clearance in healthy adults) will remove clinically significant amount of topiramate from the patient over the hemodialysis treatment period [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Hepatic Impairment Plasma clearance of topiramate decreased mean of 26% in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Age, Gender, and Race The pharmacokinetics of topiramate in elderly subjects (65 to 85 years of age, N=16) were evaluated in controlled clinical study. The elderly subject population had reduced renal function (creatinine clearance [-20%]) compared to young adults. Following single oral 100 mg dose, maximum plasma concentration for elderly and young adults was achieved at approximately to hours. Reflecting the primary renal elimination of topiramate, topiramate plasma and renal clearance were reduced 21% and 19%, respectively, in elderly subjects, compared to young adults. Similarly, topiramate half-life was longer (13%) in the elderly. Reduced topiramate clearance resulted in slightly higher maximum plasma concentration (23%) and AUC (25%) in elderly subjects than observed in young adults. Topiramate clearance is decreased in the elderly only to the extent that renal function is reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Clearance of topiramate in adults was not affected by gender or race. Pediatric Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics of topiramate were evaluated in patients age to 16 years. Patients received either no or combination of other antiepileptic drugs. population pharmacokinetic model was developed on the basis of pharmacokinetic data from relevant topiramate clinical studies. This dataset contained data from 1217 subjects including 258 pediatric patients age to 16 years (95 pediatric patients 10 years of age). Pediatric patients on adjunctive treatment exhibited higher oral clearance (L/h) of topiramate compared to patients on monotherapy, presumably because of increased clearance from concomitant enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs. In comparison, topiramate clearance per kg is greater in pediatric patients than in adults and in young pediatric patients (down to years) than in older pediatric patients. Consequently, the plasma drug concentration for the same mg/kg/day dose would be lower in pediatric patients compared to adults and also in younger pediatric patients compared to older pediatric patients. Clearance was independent of dose. As in adults, hepatic enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs decrease the steady state plasma concentrations of topiramate.Drug Interactions In vitro studies indicate that topiramate does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5 isozymes. In vitro studies indicate that topiramate is mild inhibitor of CYP2C19 and mild inducer of CYP3A4.Antiepileptic Drugs Potential interactions between topiramate and standard AEDs were assessed in controlled clinical pharmacokinetic studies in patients with epilepsy. The effects of these interactions on mean plasma AUCs are summarized in Table 11. In Table 11, the second column (AED concentration) describes what happens to the concentration of the co-administered AED listed in the first column when topiramate is added. The third column (topiramate concentration) describes how the coadministration of drug listed in the first column modifies the concentration of topiramate when compared to topiramate given alone.

In another study, exposure to EE was statistically significantly decreased at doses of 200, 400, and 800 mg/day (18%, 21%, and 30%, respectively) when given as adjunctive therapy in patients taking valproic acid. In both studies, topiramate (50 mg/day to 800 mg/day) did not significantly affect exposure to NET and there was no significant dose-dependent change in EE exposure for doses of 50 to 200 mg/day. The clinical significance of the changes observed is not known [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Digoxin In single-dose study, serum digoxin AUC was decreased by 12% with concomitant topiramate administration. The clinical relevance of this observation has not been established. Hydrochlorothiazide drug interaction study conducted in healthy volunteers evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (25 mg every 24 hours) and topiramate (96 mg every 12 hours) when administered alone and concomitantly. The results of this study indicate that topiramate Cmax increased by 27% and AUC increased by 29% when HCTZ was added to topiramate. The clinical significance of this change is unknown. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of HCTZ were not significantly influenced by the concomitant administration of topiramate. Clinical laboratory results indicated decreases in serum potassium after topiramate or HCTZ administration, which were greater when HCTZ and topiramate were administered in combination. Metformin drug interaction study conducted in healthy volunteers evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of metformin (500 mg every 12 hours) and topiramate in plasma when metformin was given alone and when metformin and topiramate (100 mg every 12 hours) were given simultaneously. The results of this study indicated that the mean metformin Cmax and AUC0-12h increased by 18% and 25%, respectively, when topiramate was added. Topiramate did not affect metformin tmax. The clinical significance of the effect of topiramate on metformin pharmacokinetics is not known. Oral plasma clearance of topiramate appears to be reduced when administered with metformin. The clinical significance of the effect of metformin on topiramate pharmacokinetics is unclear. Pioglitazone drug interaction study conducted in healthy volunteers evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of topiramate and pioglitazone when administered alone and concomitantly. 15% decrease in the AUC,ss of pioglitazone with no alteration in Cmax,ss was observed. This finding was not statistically significant. In addition, 13% and 16% decrease in Cmax,ss and AUC,ss respectively, of the active hydroxy-metabolite was noted as well as 60% decrease in Cmax,ss and AUC,ss of the active keto-metabolite. The clinical significance of these findings is not known. Glyburide drug-drug interaction study conducted in patients with type diabetes evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of glyburide (5 mg/day) alone and concomitantly with topiramate (150 mg/day). There was 22% decrease in Cmax and 25% reduction in AUC24 for glyburide during topiramate administration. Systemic exposure (AUC) of the active metabolites, 4-trans-hydroxy-glyburide (M1) and 3-cis-hydroxyglyburide (M2), was also reduced by 13% and 15%, and Cmax was reduced by 18% and 25%, respectively. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of topiramate were unaffected by concomitant administration of glyburide. Lithium In patients, the pharmacokinetics of lithium were unaffected during treatment with topiramate at doses of 200 mg/day; however, there was an observed increase in systemic exposure of lithium (27% for Cmax and 26% for AUC) following topiramate doses up to 600 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.7)] Haloperidol The pharmacokinetics of single dose of haloperidol (5 mg) were not affected following multiple dosing of topiramate (100 mg every 12 hr) in 13 healthy adults (6 males, females). Amitriptyline There was 12% increase in AUC and Cmax for amitriptyline (25 mg per day) in 18 healthy subjects (9 males, females) receiving 200 mg/day of topiramate. Sumatriptan Multiple dosing of topiramate (100 mg every 12 hours) in 24 healthy volunteers (14 males, 10 females) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of single-dose sumatriptan either orally (100 mg) or subcutaneously (6 mg). Risperidone When administered concomitantly with topiramate at escalating doses of 100, 250, and 400 mg/day, there was reduction in risperidone systemic exposure (16% and 33% for steady-state AUC at the 250 and 400 mg/day doses of topiramate). No alterations of 9-hydroxyrisperidone levels were observed. Coadministration of topiramate 400 mg/day with risperidone resulted in 14% increase in Cmax and 12% increase in AUC12 of topiramate. There were no clinically significant changes in the systemic exposure of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone or of topiramate; therefore, this interaction is not likely to be of clinical significance. Propranolol Multiple dosing of topiramate (200 mg/day) in 34 healthy volunteers (17 males, 17 females) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of propranolol following daily 160 mg doses. Propranolol doses of 160 mg/day in 39 volunteers (27 males, 12 females) had no effect on the exposure to topiramate, at dose of 200 mg/day of topiramate. Dihydroergotamine Multiple dosing of topiramate (200 mg/day) in 24 healthy volunteers (12 males, 12 females) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of 1 mg subcutaneous dose of dihydroergotamine. Similarly, 1 mg subcutaneous dose of dihydroergotamine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of 200 mg/day dose of topiramate in the same study. Diltiazem Coadministration of diltiazem (240 mg Cardizem CD(R)) with topiramate (150 mg/day) resulted in 10% decrease in Cmax and 25% decrease in diltiazem AUC, 27% decrease in Cmax and an 18% decrease in des-acetyl diltiazem AUC, and no effect on N-desmethyl diltiazem. Coadministration of topiramate with diltiazem resulted in 16% increase in Cmax and 19% increase in AUC12 of topiramate. Venlafaxine Multiple dosing of topiramate (150 mg/day) in healthy volunteers did not affect the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine or O-desmethyl venlafaxine. Multiple dosing of venlafaxine (150 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of topiramate.",9dae6824-6913-42de-b98a-cdcb0d3b4a46,34090-1,CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION

27928607,"OVERDOSAGE. There are limited data on overdose with bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide. However, several cases of overdose with bisoprolol fumarate have been reported (maximum: 2000 mg). Bradycardia and/or hypotension were noted. Sympathomimetic agents were given in some cases, and all patients recovered.The most frequently observed signs expected with overdosage of beta-blocker are bradycardia and hypotension. Lethargy is also common, and with severe overdoses, delirium, coma, convulsions, and respiratory arrest have been reported to occur. Congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia may occur, particularly in patients with underlying conditions. With thiazide diuretics, acute intoxication is rare. The most prominent feature of overdose is acute loss of fluid and electrolytes. Signs and symptoms include cardiovascular (tachycardia, hypotension, shock), neuromuscular (weakness, confusion, dizziness, cramps of the calf muscles, paresthesia, fatigue, impairment of consciousness), gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, thirst), renal (polyuria, oliguria, or anuria [due to hemoconcentration]), and laboratory findings (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, alkalosis, increased BUN [especially in patients with renal insufficiency]).If overdosage of bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide is suspected, therapy with bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued and the patient observed closely. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive; there is no specific antidote. Limited data suggest bisoprolol fumarate is not dialyzable; similarly, there is no indication that hydrochlorothiazide USP is dialyzable. Suggested general measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal, respiratory support, correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and treatment of convulsions. Based on the expected pharmacologic actions and recommendations for other beta-blockers and hydrochlorothiazide USP, the following measures should be considered when clinically warranted:Bradycardia: Administer IV atropine. If the response is inadequate, isoproterenol or another agent with positive chronotropic properties may be given cautiously. Under some circumstances, transvenous pacemaker insertion may be necessary.Hypotension, Shock: The patients legs should be elevated. IV fluids should be administered and lost electrolytes (potassium, sodium) replaced. Intravenous glucagon may be useful. Vasopressors should be considered.Heart Block (second or third degree): Patients should be carefully monitored and treated with isoproterenol infusion or transvenous cardiac pacemaker insertion, as appropriate. Congestive Heart Failure: Initiate conventional therapy (i.e., digitalis, diuretics, vasodilating agents, inotropic agents).Bronchospasm: Administer bronchodilator such as isoproterenol and/or aminophylline.Hypoglycemia: Administer IV glucose.Surveillance: Fluid and electrolyte balance (especially serum potassium) and renal function should be monitored until normalized.",ec524b62-3b42-4c36-bca6-7ef442fcd477,34088-5,OVERDOSAGE SECTION

After prolonged administration, aminocaproic acid has been found to distribute throughout extravascular and intravascular compartments of the body, penetrating human red blood cells as well as other tissue cells. Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination. Sixty-five percent of the dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug and 11% of the dose appears as the metabolite adipic acid. Renal clearance (116 mL/min) approximates endogenous creatinine clearance. The total body clearance is 169 mL/min. The terminal elimination half-life for aminocaproic acid is approximately hours.",48c6a773-7cde-4271-876a-4570a301f43a,34090-1,CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION
28587867,"12.3 Pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetics of vardenafil are approximately dose proportional over the recommended dose range. AbsorptionMean vardenafil plasma concentrations measured after the administration of single oral dose of 20 mg to healthy male volunteers are depicted in Figure 8.Figure 8: Plasma Vardenafil Concentration (Mean +- SD) Curve for Single 20 mg Vardenafil Hydrochloride Dose Vardenafil is rapidly absorbed with absolute bioavailability of approximately 15%. Maximum observed plasma concentrations after single 20 mg dose in healthy volunteers are usually reached between 30 minutes and hours (median 60 minutes) after oral dosing in the fasted state. Two food-effect studies were conducted which showed that high-fat meals caused reduction in Cmax by 18% to 50%.DistributionThe mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) for vardenafil is 208 L, indicating extensive tissue distribution. Vardenafil and its major circulating metabolite, M1, are highly bound to plasma proteins (about 95% for parent drug and M1). This protein binding is reversible and independent of total drug concentrations.Following single oral dose of 20 mg vardenafil in healthy volunteers, mean of 0.00018% of the administered dose was obtained in semen 1.5 hours after dosing.MetabolismVardenafil is metabolized predominantly by the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4, with contribution from the CYP3A5 and CYP2C isoforms. The major circulating metabolite, M1, results from desethylation at the piperazine moiety of vardenafil. M1 is subject to further metabolism. The plasma concentration of M1 is approximately 26% that of the parent compound. This metabolite shows phosphodiesterase selectivity profile similar to that of vardenafil and an in vitro inhibitory potency for PDE5 28% of that of vardenafil. Therefore, M1 accounts for approximately 7% of total pharmacologic activity.ExcretionThe total body clearance of vardenafil is 56 L/h, and the terminal half-life of vardenafil and its primary metabolite (M1) is approximately to hours. After oral administration, vardenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 91 to 95% of administered oral dose) and to lesser extent in the urine (approximately to 6% of administered oral dose).Pharmacokinetics in Specific PopulationsPediatricsVardenafil hydrochloride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Vardenafil trials were not conducted in the pediatric population. GeriatricIn healthy volunteer study of elderly males (>=65 years) and younger males (18 to 45 years), mean Cmax and AUC were 34% and 52% higher, respectively, in the elderly males [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Hepatic ImpairmentIn volunteers with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A), the Cmax and AUC following 10 mg vardenafil dose were increased by 22% and 17%, respectively, compared to healthy control subjects. In volunteers with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B), the Cmax and AUC following 10 mg vardenafil dose were increased by 130% and 160%, respectively, compared to healthy control subjects. Vardenafil has not been evaluated in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.8), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Renal ImpairmentIn male volunteers with CLcr 50 to 80 mL/min, the pharmacokinetics of vardenafil were similar to those observed in control group with CLcr >80 mL/min. In male volunteers with CLcr 30 to 50 mL/min or CLcr<30 mL/min renal impairment groups, the AUC of vardenafil was 20 to 30% higher compared to that observed in control group with CLcr>80 mL/min). Vardenafil pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated in patients requiring renal dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.9), and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

28198388,"12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. 12.1 Mechanism of Action. Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. The beneficial effects of lisinopril in hypertension and heart failure appear to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in small increase of serum potassium. In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was approximately 0.1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15% of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately 6% had decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L. In the same study, patients treated with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for up to 24 weeks had mean decrease in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L; approximately 4% of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately 12% had decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L [see Clinical Studies 14.1 )]. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, potent vasodepressor peptide, play role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated.While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system, lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually low-renin hypertensive population) had smaller average response to monotherapy than non Black patients.Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide further reduced blood pressure in Black and non-Black patients and any racial differences in blood pressure response were no longer evident.. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics. HypertensionAdult Patients: Administration of lisinopril to patients with hypertension results in reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt-depleted patients [see Warnings and Precautions 5.4 )]. When given together with thiazide-type diuretics, the blood pressure lowering effects of the two drugs are approximately additive. In most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by hours. Although an antihypertensive effect was observed 24 hours after dosing with recommended single daily doses, the effect was more consistent and the mean effect was considerably larger in some studies with doses of 20 mg or more than with lower doses; however, at all doses studied, the mean antihypertensive effect was substantially smaller 24 hours after dosing than it was hours after dosing.The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril are maintained during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with rapid increase in blood pressure, or significant increase in blood pressure compared to pretreatment levels.Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory AgentsIn study in 36 patients with mild to moderate hypertension where the antihypertensive effects of lisinopril alone were compared to lisinopril given concomitantly with indomethacin, the use of indomethacin was associated with reduced effect, although the difference between the two regimens was not significant.. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics. Adult Patients: Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations of lisinopril occur within about hours, although there was trend to small delay in time taken to reach peak serum concentrations in acute myocardial infarction patients. Food does not alter the bioavailability of lisinopril. Declining serum concentrations exhibit prolonged terminal phase, which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of 12 hours. Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25%, with large intersubject variability (6% to 60%) at all doses tested (5 mg to 80 mg). The absolute bioavailability of lisinopril is reduced to 16% in patients with stable NYHA Class II-IV congestive heart failure, and the volume of distribution appears to be slightly smaller than that in normal subjects. The oral bioavailability of lisinopril in patients with acute myocardial infarction is similar to that in healthy volunteers.Impaired renal function decreases elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this glomerular filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to attain steady state is prolonged [see Dosage and Administration 2.4 )]. Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis. Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of lisinopril were studied in 29 pediatric hypertensive patients between years and 16 years with glomerular filtration rate >30 mL/min/1.73 2. After doses of 0.1 mg per kg to 0.2 mg per kg, steady state peak plasma concentrations of lisinopril occurred within hours and the extent of absorption based on urinary recovery was about 28%. These values are similar to those obtained previously in adults. The typical value of lisinopril oral clearance (systemic clearance/absolute bioavailability) in child weighing 30 kg is 10 L/h, which increases in proportion to renal function. In multicenter, open-label pharmacokinetic study of daily oral lisinopril in 22 pediatric hypertensive patients with stable kidney transplant (ages to 17 years; estimated glomerular filtration rate >30 mL/min/1.73 2), dose normalized exposures were in the range reported previously in children without kidney transplant.",a00e3e70-9124-aebe-e053-2995a90a68ba,34090-1,CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION

28780370,"8.1 Pregnancy. Pregnancy Exposure RegistryThere is pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including quetiapine, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by contacting the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at 1-866-961-2388 or online at http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/ Risk SummaryNeonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs (including quetiapine) during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery (see Clinical Considerations). Overall available data from published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to quetiapine have not established drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia, bipolar I, or major depressive disorder, and with exposure to antipsychotics, including quetiapine, during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal studies, embryo-fetal toxicity occurred including delays in skeletal ossification at approximately and times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 800 mg/day in both rats and rabbits, and an increased incidence of carpal/tarsal flexure (minor soft tissue anomaly) in rabbit fetuses at approximately times the MRHD. In addition, fetal weights were decreased in both species. Maternal toxicity (observed as decreased body weights and/or death) occurred at times the MRHD in rats and approximately 1-2 times the MRHD in rabbits. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-associated maternal and/or fetal risk There is risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors.A prospective, longitudinal study followed 201 pregnant women with history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. The women who discontinued antidepressants during pregnancy were more likely to experience relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressants. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum.Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who were exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization.DataHuman Data Published data from observational studies, birth registries, and case reports on the use of atypical antipsychotics during pregnancy do not report clear association with antipsychotics and major birth defects. retrospective cohort study from Medicaid database of 9258 women exposed to antipsychotics during pregnancy did not indicate an overall increased risk of major birth defects.Animal Data When pregnant rats and rabbits were exposed to quetiapine during organogenesis, there was no teratogenic effect in fetuses. Doses were 25, 50 and 200 mg/kg in rats and 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg in rabbits which are approximately 0.3, 0.6 and 2-times (rats) and 0.6, and 2-times (rabbits) the MRHD for schizophrenia of 800 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area. However, there was evidence of embryo-fetal toxicity including delays in skeletal ossification at approximately and times the MRHD of 800 mg/day in both rats and rabbits, and an increased incidence of carpal/tarsal flexure (minor soft tissue anomaly) in rabbit fetuses at approximately times the MRHD. In addition, fetal weights were decreased in both species. Maternal toxicity (observed as decreased body weights and/or death) occurred at times the MRHD in rats and approximately 1-2 times the MRHD (all doses tested) in rabbits.In peri/postnatal reproductive study in rats, no drug-related effects were observed when pregnant dams were treated with quetiapine at doses 0.01, 0.1, and 0.2 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m body surface area. However, in preliminary peri/postnatal study, there were increases in fetal and pup death, and decreases in mean litter weight at times the MRHD.",cb989abf-7d73-4ab9-a07f-a8c9de50389f,42228-7,PREGNANCY SECTION

(8.1) Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy. Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to pregabalin during pregnancy. To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to pregabalin, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking pregabalin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women. However, in animal reproduction studies, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities and other manifestations of developmental toxicity, including skeletal malformations, retarded ossification, and decreased fetal body weight were observed in the offspring of rats and rabbits given pregabalin orally during organogenesis, at doses that produced plasma pregabalin exposures (AUC) greater than or equal to 16 times human exposure at the maximum recommended dose (MRD) of 600 mg/day [see Data]. In an animal development study, lethality, growth retardation, and nervous and reproductive system functional impairment were observed in the offspring of rats given pregabalin during gestation and lactation. The no-effect dose for developmental toxicity was approximately twice the human exposure at MRD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to fetus. Data Animal Data When pregnant rats were given pregabalin (500, 1,250, or 2,500 mg/kg) orally throughout the period of organogenesis, incidences of specific skull alterations attributed to abnormally advanced ossification (premature fusion of the jugal and nasal sutures) were increased at greater than or equal to 1,250 mg/kg, and incidences of skeletal variations and retarded ossification were increased at all doses. Fetal body weights were decreased at the highest dose. The low dose in this study was associated with plasma exposure (AUC) approximately 17 times human exposure at the MRD of 600 mg/day. no-effect dose for rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity was not established. When pregnant rabbits were given pregabalin (250, 500, or 1,250 mg/kg) orally throughout the period of organogenesis, decreased fetal body weight and increased incidences of skeletal malformations, visceral variations, and retarded ossification were observed at the highest dose. The no-effect dose for developmental toxicity in rabbits (500 mg/kg) was associated with plasma exposure approximately 16 times human exposure at the MRD. In study in which female rats were dosed with pregabalin (50, 100, 250, 1,250, or 2,500 mg/kg) throughout gestation and lactation, offspring growth was reduced at greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg and offspring survival was decreased at greater than or equal to 250 mg/kg. The effect on offspring survival was pronounced at doses greater than or equal to 1,250 mg/kg, with 100% mortality in high-dose litters. When offspring were tested as adults, neurobehavioral abnormalities (decreased auditory startle responding) were observed at greater than or equal to 250 mg/kg and reproductive impairment (decreased fertility and litter size) was seen at 1,250 mg/kg. The no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity in rats (50 mg/kg) produced plasma exposure approximately times human exposure at the MRD. In the prenatal-postnatal study in rats, pregabalin prolonged gestation and induced dystocia at exposures greater than or equal to 50 times the mean human exposure (AUC (0 to 24) of 123 mcgohr/mL) at the MRD. 8.2 Lactation. Risk SummarySmall amounts of pregabalin have been detected in the milk of lactating women. pharmacokinetic study in lactating women detected pregabalin in breast milk at average steady-state concentrations approximately 76% of those in maternal plasma. The estimated average daily infant dose of pregabalin from breast milk (assuming mean milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day) was 0.31 mg/kg/day, which on mg/kg basis would be approximately 7% of the maternal dose [see Data]. The study did not evaluate the effects of pregabalin on milk production or the effects of pregabalin on the breastfed infant. Based on animal studies, there is potential risk of tumorigenicity with pregabalin exposure via breast milk to the breastfed infant [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] Available clinical study data in patients greater than 12 years of age do not provide clear conclusion about the potential risk of tumorigenicity with pregabalin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Because of the potential risk of tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pregabalin. DataA pharmacokinetic study in ten lactating women, who were at least 12 weeks postpartum, evaluated the concentrations of pregabalin in plasma and breast milk. Pregabalin 150 mg oral capsule was given every 12 hours (300 mg daily dose) for total of four doses. Pregabalin was detected in breast milk at average steady-state concentrations approximately 76% of those in maternal plasma. The estimated average daily infant dose of pregabalin from breast milk (assuming mean milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day) was 0.31 mg/kg/day, which on mg/kg basis would be approximately 7% of the maternal dose. The study did not evaluate the effects of pregabalin on milk production. Infants did not receive breast milk obtained during the dosing period, therefore, the effects of pregabalin on the breast fed infant were not evaluated. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential. Infertility Male Effects on Spermatogenesis In randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority study to assess the effect of pregabalin on sperm characteristics, healthy male subjects received pregabalin at daily dose up to 600 mg (n=111) or placebo (n=109) for 13 weeks (one complete sperm cycle) followed by 13-week washout period (off-drug). total of 65 subjects in the pregabalin group (59%) and 62 subjects in the placebo group (57%) were included in the per protocol (PP) population. These subjects took study drug for at least weeks, had appropriate timing of semen collections and did not have any significant protocol violations. Among these subjects, approximately 9% of the pregabalin group (6/65) vs. 3% in the placebo group (2/62) had greater than or equal to 50% reduction in mean sperm concentrations from baseline at Week 26 (the primary endpoint). The difference between pregabalin and placebo was within the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 20%. There were no adverse effects of pregabalin on sperm morphology, sperm motility, serum FSH or serum testosterone levels as compared to placebo. In subjects in the PP population with greater than or equal to 50% reduction in sperm concentration from baseline, sperm concentrations were no longer reduced by greater than or equal to 50% in any affected subject after an additional months off-drug. In one subject, however, subsequent semen analyses demonstrated reductions from baseline of greater than or equal to 50% at and 12 months off-drug. The clinical relevance of these data is unknown. In the animal fertility study with pregabalin in male rats, adverse reproductive and developmental effects were observed [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use. Neuropathic Pain Associated with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy, Postherpetic Neuralgia, and Neuropathic Pain Associated with Spinal Cord InjurySafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.FibromyalgiaSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.A 15-week, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with 107 pediatric patients with fibromyalgia, ages 12 through 17 years, at pregabalin total daily doses of 75 to 450 mg per day. The primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline to Week 15 in mean pain intensity (derived from an 11-point numeric rating scale) showed numerically greater improvement for the pregabalin-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients, but did not reach statistical significance. The most frequently observed adverse reactions in the clinical trial included dizziness, nausea, headache, weight increased, and fatigue. The overall safety profile in adolescents was similar to that observed in adults with fibromyalgia.Adjunctive Therapy for Partial-Onset SeizuresSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of month have not been established.Juvenile Animal Data In studies in which pregabalin (50 to 500 mg/kg) was orally administered to young rats from early in the postnatal period (Postnatal Day 7) through sexual maturity, neurobehavioral abnormalities (deficits in learning and memory, altered locomotor activity, decreased auditory startle responding and habituation) and reproductive impairment (delayed sexual maturation and decreased fertility in males and females) were observed at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg. The neurobehavioral changes of acoustic startle persisted at greater than or equal to 250 mg/kg and locomotor activity and water maze performance at greater than or equal to 500 mg/kg in animals tested after cessation of dosing and, thus, were considered to represent long-term effects. The low effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity and reproductive impairment in juvenile rats (50 mg/kg) was associated with plasma pregabalin exposure (AUC) approximately equal to human exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 600 mg/day. no-effect dose was not established. Information describing clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated in patients is approved for Pfizer Inc.s Lyrica (R) (pregabalin) products. Additional pediatric use information is approved for Pfizers LYRICA (pregabalin) Capsules. However, due to Pfizers marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.. 8.5 Geriatric Use. In controlled clinical studies of pregabalin in neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, 246 patients were 65 to 74 years of age, and 73 patients were 75 years of age or older. In controlled clinical studies of pregabalin in neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia, 282 patients were 65 to 74 years of age, and 379 patients were 75 years of age or older. In controlled clinical studies of pregabalin in epilepsy, there were only 10 patients 65 to 74 years of age, and patients who were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety and efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients. In controlled clinical studies of pregabalin in fibromyalgia, 106 patients were 65 years of age or older. Although the adverse reaction profile was similar between the two age groups, the following neurological adverse reactions were more frequent in patients 65 years of age or older: dizziness, vision blurred, balance disorder, tremor, confusional state, coordination abnormal, and lethargy. Pregabalin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to pregabalin may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because pregabalin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, adjust the dose for elderly patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)] . 8.6 Renal Impairment. Pregabalin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion and dose adjustment is recommended for adult patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The use of pregabalin in pediatric patients with compromised renal function has not been studied.",9111d695-9f3a-4b07-9daa-c1339b16acb3,43684-0,USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS SECTION
28173441,"12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. 12.1 Mechanism of Action. The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges.. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics. AbsorptionFor extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least to 10 days (5 to half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least to half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved.. DistributionPhenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins.. EliminationThe plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with range of to 42 hours.. MetabolismPhenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more.In most patients maintained at steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal.. ExcretionMost of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion.. Specific Populations. Age: Geriatric Population:Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Sex/Race:Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics.. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported.. Pregnancy:It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery.. Drug Interaction StudiesPhenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Phenytoin is potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)].",ef4e97a7-cd18-47a9-a016-2eca5481a87e,34090-1,CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION

28303640,"8.1 Pregnancy. Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including levetiracetam tablets extended-release, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking levetiracetam tablets extended-release during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or visiting http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.Risk Summary Prolonged experience with levetiracetam tablets in pregnant women has not identified drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage, based on published literature, which includes data from pregnancy registries and reflects experience over two decades [see Human Data]. In animal studies, levetiracetam produced developmental toxicity (increased embryofetal and offspring mortality, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities, decreased embryofetal and offspring growth, neurobehavioral alterations in offspring) at doses similar to human therapeutic doses [see Animal Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.Clinical ConsiderationsExtended-release levetiracetam tablets level may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Physiological changes during pregnancy may affect levetiracetam concentration. Decrease in levetiracetam plasma concentrations has been observed during pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. Dose adjustments may be necessary to maintain clinical response.DataHuman Data:While available studies cannot definitively establish the absence of risk, data from the published literature and pregnancy registries have not established an association with levetiracetam use during pregnancy and major birth defects or miscarriage.Animal DataWhen levetiracetam (0, 400, 1200, or 3600 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, reduced fetal weights and increased incidence of fetal skeletal variations were observed at the highest dose tested. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal developmental in rats (1200 mg/kg/day) is approximately times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3000 mg on body surface area (mg/m2) basis.Oral administration of levetiracetam (0, 200, 600, or 1800 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased embryofetal mortality and incidence of fetal skeletal variations at the mid and high dose and decreased fetal weights and increased incidence of fetal malformations at the high dose, which was associated with maternal toxicity. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rabbits (200 mg/kg/day) is approximately equivalent to the MRHD on mg/m2 basis.Oral administration of levetiracetam (0, 70, 350, or 1800 mg/kg/day) to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation led to an increased incidence of fetal skeletal variations, reduced fetal body weight, and decreased growth in offspring at the mid and high doses and increased pup mortality and neurobehavioral alterations in offspring at the highest dose tested. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on pre-and postnatal development in rats (70 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on mg/m2 basis.Oral administration of levetiracetam to rats during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation produced no adverse developmental or maternal effects at doses of up to 1800 mg/kg/day (6 times the MRHD on mg/m2 basis).",18648f51-a37c-41e1-b451-123bc0cf5446,42228-7,PREGNANCY SECTION

Instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.Advise patients regarding the following issues and to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-release (SR) tablets.. Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors: Instruct patients, their families, and/or their caregivers to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Advise families and caregivers of patients to observe for the emergence of such symptoms on day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patients prescriber or healthcare professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patients presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events and Suicide Risk in Smoking Cessation Treatment: Although Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-release (SR) tablets are not indicated for smoking cessation treatment, it contains the same active ingredient as ZYBAN(R) which is approved for this use. Inform patients that some patients have experienced changes in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, aggression, hostility, agitation, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation and suicide when attempting to quit smoking while taking bupropion. Instruct patients to discontinue bupropion and contact healthcare professional if they experience such symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Severe Allergic Reactions: Educate patients on the symptoms of hypersensitivity and to discontinue Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-release (SR) tablets if they have severe allergic reaction.. Seizure: Instruct patients to discontinue and not restart Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-release (SR) tablets if they experience seizure while on treatment. Advise patients that the excessive use or abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs, or sedatives/hypnotics can increase the risk of seizure. Advise patients to minimize or avoid use of alcohol.As the dose is increased during initial titration to doses above 150 mg per day, instruct patients to take Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-release (SR) tablets in divided doses, preferably with at least hours between successive doses, to minimize the risk of seizures.. Angle-Closure Glaucoma: Patients should be advised that taking Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-release (SR) tablets can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle-closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle glaucoma is not risk factor for angle-closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle closure, and have prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].. Bupropion-Containing Products: Educate patients that Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-release (SR) tablets contain the same active ingredient (bupropion hydrochloride) found in ZYBAN, which is used as an aid to smoking cessation treatment, and that Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-release (SR) tablets should not be used in combination with ZYBAN or any other medications that contain bupropion (such as WELLBUTRIN, the immediate-release formulation and Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (XL) tablets or FORFIVO XL, the extended- release formulations, and APLENZIN, the extended-release formulation of bupropion hydrobromide). In addition, there are number of generic bupropion HCl products for the immediate-, sustained-, and extended-release formulations.. Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment: Advise patients that any CNS-active drug like Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-release (SR) tablets may impair their ability to perform tasks requiring judgment or motor and cognitive skills.

Cefprozil is generally effective in the eradication of Streptococcus pyogenes from the nasopharynx; however, substantial data establishing the efficacy of cefprozil in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available at present.Otitis Media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including -lactamase-producing strains), and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (including -lactamase-producing strains). (See CLINICAL STUDIES.)NOTE: In the treatment of otitis media due to -lactamase producing organisms, cefprozil had bacteriologic eradication rates somewhat lower than those observed with product containing specific -lactamase inhibitor. In considering the use of cefprozil, lower overall eradication rates should be balanced against the susceptibility patterns of the common microbes in given geographic area and the increased potential for toxicity with products containing -lactamase inhibitors.Acute Sinusitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including -lactamase-producing strains), and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (including -lactamase-producing strains)..

28438246,"9.2 Abuse. Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablet contains tramadol, substance with high potential for abuse similar to other opioids. Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [see Warnings and Precautions 5.1)]. The high drug content in extended-release formulations adds to the risk of adverse outcomes from abuse and misuse. All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.Drug addiction is cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes physical withdrawal.Drug-seeking behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated loss of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare providers. Doctor shopping (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in patient with poor pain control.Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.Risks Specific to Abuse of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release TabletsTramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets are for oral use only. The abuse of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets poses risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. With intravenous abuse the inactive ingredients in tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets can result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, embolism and death, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury.

28356491,"DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE. Diazepam is subject to Schedule IV control under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Abuse and dependence of benzodiazepines have been reported. Addiction-prone individuals (such as drug addicts or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance when receiving diazepam or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition of such patients to habituation and dependence. Once physical dependence to benzodiazepines has developed, termination of treatment will be accompanied by withdrawal symptoms. The risk is more pronounced in patients on long-term therapy.Withdrawal symptoms, similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of diazepam. These withdrawal symptoms may consist of tremor, abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, headache, muscle pain, extreme anxiety, tension, restlessness, confusion and irritability. In severe cases, the following symptoms may occur: derealization, depersonalization, hyperacusis, numbness and tingling of the extremities, hypersensitivity to light, noise and physical contact, hallucinations or epileptic seizures. The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who had received excessive doses over an extended period of time. Generally milder withdrawal symptoms (e.g., dysphoria and insomnia) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently, after extended therapy, abrupt discontinuation should generally be avoided and gradual dosage tapering schedule followed.Chronic use (even at therapeutic doses) may lead to the development of physical dependence: discontinuation of the therapy may result in withdrawal or rebound phenomena.. Rebound Anxiety. transient syndrome whereby the symptoms that led to treatment with diazepam recur in an enhanced form. This may occur upon discontinuation of treatment. It may be accompanied by other reactions including mood changes, anxiety, and restlessness.Since the risk of withdrawal phenomena and rebound phenomena is greater after abrupt discontinuation of treatment, it is recommended that the dosage be decreased gradually.",5fc7d5df-9270-4a00-e053-2a91aa0a2059,42227-9,DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE SECTION
