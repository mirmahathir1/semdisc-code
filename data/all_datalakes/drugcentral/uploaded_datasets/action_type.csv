33,ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR,Allosteric modulator is a substance which indirectly modulates the effects of a receptor agonist or inverse agonist at its receptor protein target.,OTHER
35,GATING INHIBITOR,Inhibit the opening or closing of the channel in response to stimuli,OTHER
31,MEMBRANE PERMEABILIZER,Permeabilization of the cell membrane,OTHER
32,DNA STRAND BREAK,A DNA Strand Break involves one or more disruptions of the covalent linkages among phosphodeoxyribose moieties within the sugar-phosphate backbone in one or in both strands of a DNA molecule.,OTHER
30,PHARMACOLOGICAL CHAPERONE,Pharmaceutical chaperones may help stabilize the protein structure thereby restoring folding and/or preventing misfolding of the protein,OTHER
29,SEQUESTERING AGENT,"Binds to a substance such as a drug, toxin or metabolite reducing its availability for further interactions",OTHER
28,ALKYLATING AGENT,Introduce alkyl radicals into biologically active molecules and thereby prevent their proper functioning,OTHER
26,MINIMUM INHIBITORY CONCENTRATION,The lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that will inhibit the visible growth of a microorganism,OTHER
27,ANTIBODY BINDING,Antibody binding activity,OTHER
1,ACTIVATOR,"Positively effects the normal functioning of the protein e.g., activation of an enzyme or cleaving a clotting protein precursor",POSITIVE MODULATOR
2,AGONIST,"Binds to and activates a receptor, often mimicking the effect of the endogenous ligand",POSITIVE MODULATOR
3,ALLOSTERIC ANTAGONIST,Binds to a receptor at an allosteric site and prevents activation by a positive allosteric modulator at that site,NEGATIVE MODULATOR
4,ANTAGONIST,Binds to a receptor and prevents activation by an agonist through competing for the binding site,NEGATIVE MODULATOR
5,ANTISENSE INHIBITOR,Prevents translation of a complementary mRNA sequence through binding to it,NEGATIVE MODULATOR
6,BINDING AGENT,"Binds to a substance such as a cell surface antigen, targetting a drug to that location, but not necessarily affecting the functioning of the substance itself",OTHER
7,BLOCKER,"Negatively effects the normal functioning of an ion channel e.g., prevents or reduces transport of ions through the channel",NEGATIVE MODULATOR
8,CHELATING AGENT,"Binds to a substance such as a metal, toxin or metabolite reducing its availability for further interactions",OTHER
9,CROSS-LINKING AGENT,Induces cross-linking of proteins or nucleic acids,OTHER
10,HYDROLYTIC ENZYME,Hydrolyses a substrate through enzymatic reaction,OTHER
11,INHIBITOR,"Negatively effects (inhibits) the normal functioning of the protein e.g., prevention of enzymatic reaction or activation of downstream pathway",NEGATIVE MODULATOR
12,INVERSE AGONIST,Binds to and inactivates a receptor,NEGATIVE MODULATOR
13,MODULATOR,"Effects the normal functioning of a protein in some way e.g., mixed agonist/antagonist or unclear whether action is positive or negative",OTHER
14,NEGATIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR,Reduces or prevents the action of the endogenous ligand of a receptor through binding to a site distinct from that ligand (non-competitive inhibition),NEGATIVE MODULATOR
15,NEGATIVE MODULATOR,"Negatively effects the normal functioning of a protein e.g., receptor antagonist, inverse agonist or negative allosteric modulator",NEGATIVE MODULATOR
16,OPENER,"Positively effects the normal functioning of an ion channel e.g., facilitates transport of ions through the channel",POSITIVE MODULATOR
17,OTHER,"Other action type, not clearly postively or negatively affecting the normal functioning of a protein e.g., chelation of substances, hydrolysis of substrate",OTHER
18,OXIDATIVE ENZYME,Oxidises a substrate through enzymatic reaction,OTHER
19,PARTIAL AGONIST,Binds to and only partially activates a receptor (relative to the response to a full agonist),POSITIVE MODULATOR
20,POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR,Enhances the action of the endogenous ligand of a receptor through binding to a site distinct from that ligand,POSITIVE MODULATOR
21,POSITIVE MODULATOR,"Positively effects the normal functioning of a protein e.g., receptor agonist, positive allosteric modulator, ion channel activator",POSITIVE MODULATOR
22,PROTEOLYTIC ENZYME,Hydrolyses a protein substrate through enzymatic reaction,OTHER
23,RELEASING AGENT,"Reverses the normal functioning of a transporter, causing release of the substrate, rather than uptake",NEGATIVE MODULATOR
24,SUBSTRATE,"Carried by a transporter, possibly competing with the natural substrate for transport",OTHER
